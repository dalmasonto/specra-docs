# What is Specra?

Specra is a modern documentation framework that makes writing and publishing technical documentation actually enjoyable. Built on top of Next.js, MDX, and Tailwind CSS, it gives you the polished look and feel of premium documentation platforms like Mintlify, but you host it yourself.

If you've ever struggled with clunky documentation tools or paid way too much for hosted solutions, Specra is here to change that. Write your docs in Markdown, add interactive components when you need them, and deploy anywhere you want.

## Why We Built Specra

Documentation shouldn't be hard. You should be able to focus on writing great content, not wrestling with configuration files or fighting against your tools. Here's what we believe:

**Content comes first.** Drop your MDX files into a folder, and Specra handles the rest. No manual routing, no navigation setup, no build configuration headaches.

**Developer experience matters.** Hot reload means you see changes instantly. TypeScript keeps you safe. The component library is there when you need it, invisible when you don't.

**Performance is non-negotiable.** Pre-rendered pages, edge caching, optimized images. Your docs load fast, always.

**Flexibility over lock-in.** Deploy to Vercel, GitHub Pages, Netlify, or anywhere that runs Node.js or serves static files. You own your content and your infrastructure.

</CardGrid>

## The Stack

We built Specra on proven, modern technologies:

- **Next.js 15+** with the App Router for optimal performance and developer experience
- **MDX** so you can write Markdown with React components mixed in
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling that's both powerful and maintainable
- **MeiliSearch** for search that's fast and forgiving of typos
- **TypeScript** because type safety saves time and sanity

## What You Get

When you use Specra, you get a complete documentation system:

**Rich Content Components**
Callouts, tabs, code blocks with syntax highlighting, cards, accordions, steps, diagrams with Mermaid, math equations with KaTeX, and more.

**Automatic Navigation**
Your folder structure becomes your sidebar. Add a `_category_.json` file to customize sections. That's it.

**Smart Features**
Reading time estimates, last updated timestamps, tag support, breadcrumbs, responsive table of contents with scroll tracking.

**API Documentation**
Generate beautiful API references from OpenAPI specs, Postman collections, or Specra's own format. Interactive playground included.

**Multi-Version Support**
Maintain docs for v1, v2, v3 simultaneously. Version switcher lets users jump between them instantly.

**Search That Works**
Full-text search with keyboard shortcuts (⌘K or Ctrl+K). Works offline with local search or scales up with MeiliSearch.

**Theme System**
Respects system preferences, supports manual dark/light toggle, customizable via CSS variables.

**Production Ready**
SEO optimization, accessibility baked in, security headers, performance monitoring, CI/CD examples.

## How It Works

Specra follows a simple philosophy: you write, we handle the rest.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write in MDX">
    Create `.mdx` files in your `docs/` folder. Use frontmatter for metadata. Write Markdown for content. Mix in React components when needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Auto-Generation">
    Specra scans your files, generates navigation, extracts headings for the table of contents, and sets up routing automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Instant Preview">
    Run the dev server and see changes live as you type. Hot reload keeps you in flow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy Anywhere">
    Build for Node.js hosting (Vercel, Railway) or export as static files (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages). One codebase, multiple deployment targets.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Who Should Use Specra?

Specra is perfect for:

- **Open source maintainers** who need professional docs without the hosting fees
- **Startups** that want great documentation without enterprise pricing
- **API developers** who need versioned docs and interactive API references
- **Technical writers** who prefer Markdown over WYSIWYG editors
- **Teams** that want docs living in the same repo as their code
