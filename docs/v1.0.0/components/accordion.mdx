The Accordion component creates collapsible content sections, perfect for FAQs, expandable menus, or organizing large amounts of content.

## Usage

```mdx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="First Question" defaultOpen>
    This content is visible by default because of `defaultOpen`.
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="Second Question">
    This content is collapsed by default.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

## Live Example

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="What is an Accordion?" defaultOpen>
    An accordion is a UI pattern that allows users to expand and collapse sections of content. It's useful for organizing information in a compact, scannable format.
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="When should I use Accordions?">
    Use accordions when you have multiple sections of content that users may want to browse without scrolling through everything. Common use cases include FAQs, feature lists, and configuration options.
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="Can I have multiple items open?">
    Yes! By default, the Accordion allows multiple items to be open simultaneously. Each AccordionItem operates independently.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
