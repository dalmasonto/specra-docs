# Deploy to Vercel

Vercel is the easiest way to deploy your Specra documentation. It's built by the creators of Next.js, so everything works perfectly out of the box.

## Why Vercel?

- **Zero configuration** - Automatic detection and setup
- **Instant deployments** - Live in under 60 seconds
- **Automatic HTTPS** - SSL certificates included
- **Edge network** - Fast loading worldwide
- **Preview deployments** - Every git push gets a URL
- **Free tier** - Generous limits for documentation sites

## Quick Deploy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Push to GitHub">
    If you haven't already, push your project to GitHub:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
git push -u origin main
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import to Vercel">
    1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
    2. Click "Import Git Repository"
    3. Select your documentation repository
    4. Vercel auto-detects Next.js and configures everything

    No manual configuration needed!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click "Deploy" and wait about 30-60 seconds.

    You'll get a production URL like `your-project.vercel.app`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
That's it! Your documentation is now live with automatic HTTPS and global CDN.
</Callout>

## Configuration

Vercel automatically uses these settings for Next.js projects:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Build Command | `npm run build` |
| Output Directory | `.next` |
| Install Command | `npm install` |
| Node Version | 20.x (latest LTS) |

### Override Settings (Optional)

If you need custom settings, create `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "installCommand": "npm ci",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1"]
}
```

## Environment Variables

Add environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Project Settings">
    Click your project → Settings → Environment Variables
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Variables">
    Add your variables one by one:

```
MEILISEARCH_HOST=https://search.example.com
MEILISEARCH_API_KEY=your-search-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

<Callout type="tip">
Variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser. Keep sensitive keys without this prefix.
</Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Redeploy">
    Environment changes require a redeploy. Go to Deployments → Click the three dots → Redeploy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom Domain

Add your own domain to your Vercel project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Domain">
    1. Go to Project Settings → Domains
    2. Enter your domain (e.g., `docs.example.com`)
    3. Click "Add"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure DNS">
    Vercel shows you the DNS records to add. Typically:

**For subdomain (docs.example.com):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: docs
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

**For apex domain (example.com):**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Verification">
    DNS propagation takes 5 minutes to 48 hours (usually under an hour).

    Vercel automatically provisions an SSL certificate once DNS is verified.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Automatic Deployments

Every git push triggers a deployment:

**Production Deployments:**
- Commits to `main` branch deploy to production
- Updates your live site automatically

**Preview Deployments:**
- Commits to other branches get preview URLs
- Pull requests get unique URLs for testing
- Perfect for reviewing changes before merging

### Preview URLs

Each preview deployment gets a unique URL:

```
your-project-git-feature-branch-username.vercel.app
```

Share this with your team to review changes before going live.

## Deployment Settings

### Branch Configuration

Control which branches deploy:

1. Go to Settings → Git
2. Set Production Branch (usually `main`)
3. Enable/disable preview deployments for other branches

### Deployment Protection

Protect production deployments:

```json
{
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": true,
      "staging": "preview"
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

Vercel automatically optimizes your deployment:

- **Edge caching** - Static files cached globally
- **Image optimization** - Next.js Image component optimized automatically
- **Compression** - Gzip/Brotli compression enabled
- **HTTP/2** - Faster multiplexed connections

### Analytics

Enable Vercel Analytics for free:

1. Go to Analytics tab
2. Click "Enable Analytics"
3. Add the Analytics component to your layout

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Analytics />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## CI/CD Integration

Vercel acts as your CI/CD pipeline:

**What runs on every deployment:**
- `npm install` (dependencies)
- `npm run build` (Next.js build)
- Automatic checks and validations
- Deploy to edge network

### GitHub Integration

Vercel comments on pull requests with:
- Preview deployment URL
- Build logs
- Performance insights

### Build Logs

View detailed build logs:
1. Go to Deployments
2. Click any deployment
3. View the Building section for logs

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Check Node version:**
Ensure you're using Node 18+. Add to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Clear build cache:**
1. Go to Settings → General
2. Scroll to Build & Development Settings
3. Clear build cache

### Environment Variables Not Working

- Check variable names (case-sensitive)
- Prefix client-side variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- Redeploy after changing variables

### Custom Domain Not Working

- Verify DNS records are correct
- Wait for DNS propagation (check with `dig` or `nslookup`)
- Ensure CNAME points to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
- Check domain verification status in Vercel dashboard

## Monorepo Deployment

If your docs are in a monorepo:

1. Set Root Directory in project settings
2. Point to your docs folder (e.g., `apps/docs`)
3. Vercel builds only that directory

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd ../.. && npm run build:docs",
  "outputDirectory": ".next"
}
```

## Best Practices

**Use preview deployments** - Test changes before merging to main

**Enable branch protection** - Require preview deployment success before merging

**Set up notifications** - Get Slack/email alerts for deployment status

**Monitor analytics** - Track page views and performance

**Use edge config** - Store feature flags and config at the edge for instant updates

## Pricing

Vercel's free tier includes:
- Unlimited deployments
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- Automatic HTTPS
- Preview deployments
- Analytics (basic)

This is usually enough for documentation sites. Upgrade to Pro if you need:
- More bandwidth
- Advanced analytics
- Password protection
- Enterprise support
