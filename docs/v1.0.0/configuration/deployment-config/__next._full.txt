# What is Specra?

Specra is a modern documentation framework that makes writing and publishing technical documentation actually enjoyable. Built on top of Next.js, MDX, and Tailwind CSS, it gives you the polished look and feel of premium documentation platforms like Mintlify, but you host it yourself.

If you've ever struggled with clunky documentation tools or paid way too much for hosted solutions, Specra is here to change that. Write your docs in Markdown, add interactive components when you need them, and deploy anywhere you want.

## Why We Built Specra

Documentation shouldn't be hard. You should be able to focus on writing great content, not wrestling with configuration files or fighting against your tools. Here's what we believe:

**Content comes first.** Drop your MDX files into a folder, and Specra handles the rest. No manual routing, no navigation setup, no build configuration headaches.

**Developer experience matters.** Hot reload means you see changes instantly. TypeScript keeps you safe. The component library is there when you need it, invisible when you don't.

**Performance is non-negotiable.** Pre-rendered pages, edge caching, optimized images. Your docs load fast, always.

**Flexibility over lock-in.** Deploy to Vercel, GitHub Pages, Netlify, or anywhere that runs Node.js or serves static files. You own your content and your infrastructure.

## Key Features

<CardGrid cols={2}>
  <Card icon="zap" title="Lightning Fast" description="Static site generation with edge caching. Your docs load in milliseconds, not seconds." />
  <Card icon="search" title="Powerful Search" description="MeiliSearch integration gives you typo-tolerant, instant search that actually works." />
  <Card icon="git-branch" title="Version Management" description="Ship multiple doc versions side by side. Perfect for APIs and libraries with breaking changes." />
  <Card icon="palette" title="Beautiful Theming" description="Dark mode out of the box. Customize colors, fonts, and styles to match your brand." />
  <Card icon="code" title="MDX Components" description="Use Markdown for content, React components for interactivity. Best of both worlds." />
  <Card icon="layout" title="Smart Navigation" description="Auto-generated sidebar from your file structure. Collapsible sections, breadcrumbs, table of contents." />
</CardGrid>

## The Stack

We built Specra on proven, modern technologies:

- **Next.js 15+** with the App Router for optimal performance and developer experience
- **MDX** so you can write Markdown with React components mixed in
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling that's both powerful and maintainable
- **MeiliSearch** for search that's fast and forgiving of typos
- **TypeScript** because type safety saves time and sanity

## What You Get

When you use Specra, you get a complete documentation system:

**Rich Content Components**
Callouts, tabs, code blocks with syntax highlighting, cards, accordions, steps, diagrams with Mermaid, math equations with KaTeX, and more.

**Automatic Navigation**
Your folder structure becomes your sidebar. Add a `_category_.json` file to customize sections. That's it.

**Smart Features**
Reading time estimates, last updated timestamps, tag support, breadcrumbs, responsive table of contents with scroll tracking.

**API Documentation**
Generate beautiful API references from OpenAPI specs, Postman collections, or Specra's own format. Interactive playground included.

**Multi-Version Support**
Maintain docs for v1, v2, v3 simultaneously. Version switcher lets users jump between them instantly.

**Search That Works**
Full-text search with keyboard shortcuts (⌘K or Ctrl+K). Works offline with local search or scales up with MeiliSearch.

**Theme System**
Respects system preferences, supports manual dark/light toggle, customizable via CSS variables.

**Production Ready**
SEO optimization, accessibility baked in, security headers, performance monitoring, CI/CD examples.

## How It Works

Specra follows a simple philosophy: you write, we handle the rest.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write in MDX">
    Create `.mdx` files in your `docs/` folder. Use frontmatter for metadata. Write Markdown for content. Mix in React components when needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Auto-Generation">
    Specra scans your files, generates navigation, extracts headings for the table of contents, and sets up routing automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Instant Preview">
    Run the dev server and see changes live as you type. Hot reload keeps you in flow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy Anywhere">
    Build for Node.js hosting (Vercel, Railway) or export as static files (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages). One codebase, multiple deployment targets.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Who Should Use Specra?

Specra is perfect for:

- **Open source maintainers** who need professional docs without the hosting fees
- **Startups** that want great documentation without enterprise pricing
- **API developers** who need versioned docs and interactive API references
- **Technical writers** who prefer Markdown over WYSIWYG editors
- **Teams** that want docs living in the same repo as their code

Specra provides a powerful yet flexible system for documenting REST APIs. Whether you have 5 endpoints or 500, we've got you covered.

## Two Approaches

### 1. Auto-Generated Documentation

Perfect for large APIs or when you already have specs.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 not-prose my-6">
  <div className="border border-border rounded-lg p-4">
    <div className="text-2xl mb-2">📋</div>
    <h4 className="font-semibold mb-1">Specra Format</h4>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Simple JSON format</p>
  </div>
  <div className="border border-border rounded-lg p-4">
    <div className="text-2xl mb-2">🔧</div>
    <h4 className="font-semibold mb-1">OpenAPI 3.x</h4>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Industry standard</p>
  </div>
  <div className="border border-border rounded-lg p-4">
    <div className="text-2xl mb-2">📮</div>
    <h4 className="font-semibold mb-1">Postman v2.x</h4>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Export from Postman</p>
  </div>
</div>

Simply create or export your spec file and reference it:

```mdx
<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/my-api.json" />
```

The system **auto-detects** the format and generates beautiful, interactive documentation.

**Examples:**
- [Specra Format (JSONPlaceholder) →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-test)
- [OpenAPI 3.0 Format →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-openapi)
- [Postman Collection →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-postman)

[Learn More About Formats →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-formats)

---

### 2. Manual MDX Components

Perfect for small APIs or when you need custom layouts.

Use individual components to craft your documentation:

```mdx
<ApiEndpoint
  method="GET"
  path="/api/users/:id"
  summary="Get user by ID"
>
  <ApiParams params={[...]} />
  <ApiResponse status={200} example={{...}} />
  <ApiPlayground method="GET" path="/api/users/123" />
</ApiEndpoint>
```

**Example:**
- [Manual Component Example →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-example)

---

## Quick Start

### Auto-Generated (Recommended)

1. **Create your spec file** (Specra, OpenAPI, or Postman)
2. **Place it in** `/public/api-specs/my-api.json`
3. **Add to your MDX**:

```mdx
---
title: API Reference
---

# My API Documentation

<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/my-api.json" />
```

That's it! You now have:
- ✅ Auto-generated endpoint documentation
- ✅ Interactive API playground
- ✅ Collapsible accordion UI
- ✅ Syntax-highlighted examples
- ✅ Request/response schemas

### Manual Components

1. **Create an MDX file** in `docs/`
2. **Use API components**:

```mdx
---
title: API Reference
---

# My API

<ApiEndpoint method="GET" path="/users" summary="List users">
  <ApiParams
    title="Query Parameters"
    params={[
      { name: "page", type: "number", description: "Page number" }
    ]}
  />

  <ApiResponse
    status={200}
    description="Success"
    example={[{ id: 1, name: "John" }]}
  />

  <ApiPlayground
    method="GET"
    path="/users"
    baseUrl="https://api.example.com"
  />
</ApiEndpoint>
```

## Available Components

### `<ApiReference>`

Auto-generate docs from spec files.

```tsx
<ApiReference
  spec="/api-specs/my-api.json"  // Path to spec file
  parser="auto"                   // auto | specra | openapi | postman
  showPlayground={true}           // Show interactive playground
/>
```

### `<ApiEndpoint>`

Document a single endpoint (accordion-style).

```tsx
<ApiEndpoint
  method="GET"              // GET | POST | PUT | PATCH | DELETE
  path="/api/users/:id"     // API path
  summary="Get user by ID"  // Short description
  defaultOpen={false}       // Start expanded?
>
  {/* Child components */}
</ApiEndpoint>
```

### `<ApiParams>`

Display parameters (path, query, body).

```tsx
<ApiParams
  title="Path Parameters"
  params={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      description: "User ID",
      example: "user_123"
    }
  ]}
/>
```

### `<ApiResponse>`

Show response examples.

```tsx
<ApiResponse
  status={200}
  description="User found"
  example={{
    id: "user_123",
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com"
  }}
/>
```

### `<ApiPlayground>`

Interactive API testing.

```tsx
<ApiPlayground
  method="GET"
  path="/users/:id"
  baseUrl="https://api.example.com"
  headers={{ "Authorization": "Bearer ..." }}
  pathParams={[
    { name: "id", type: "string", example: "user_123" }
  ]}
  defaultBody='{"key": "value"}'
/>
```

## Features

### Interactive Playground

Every endpoint includes a built-in playground where users can:
- ✅ Edit path parameters
- ✅ Modify request headers
- ✅ Update request body
- ✅ Send real API requests
- ✅ View formatted responses

### Accordion UI

Endpoints are collapsible by default, making it easy to:
- Browse many endpoints quickly
- Expand only what you need
- Keep the page clean and organized

### Syntax Highlighting

All code examples include:
- JSON syntax highlighting
- Line numbers
- Copy button
- Dark mode support

### Authentication

Document your auth requirements:
- Bearer tokens
- API keys
- Basic auth
- Custom headers

## Format Support

| Format | Version | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Specra** | 1.0 | Simple, custom format for any API |
| **OpenAPI** | 3.x, Swagger 2.0 | Industry standard, code generation |

### Manual Components

Hand-crafted for custom needs:

[View Manual Example →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-example)

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Approach

**Use auto-generated** when:
- You have > 10 endpoints
- You already have a spec file
- You want consistency
- You need code generation

**Use manual components** when:
- You have < 10 endpoints
- You need custom layouts
- You want full control
- You're documenting gradually

### 2. Provide Examples

Always include realistic examples:
- Request bodies with actual data
- Response examples that match reality
- Edge cases and errors
- Authentication examples

### 3. Keep It Updated

**For auto-generated docs:**
- Regenerate specs when code changes
- Re-export Postman collections regularly
- Version your spec files

**For manual docs:**
- Review when API changes
- Test playground regularly
- Update examples

### 4. Organize by Feature

Group related endpoints:

```mdx
## User Management

<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/users.json" />

## Product Catalog

<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/products.json" />

## Orders

<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/orders.json" />
```

### 5. Add Context

Enhance with explanatory text:

```mdx
## Authentication

All endpoints require a valid JWT token.

<Callout type="info">
Get your API key from the [developer dashboard](https://example.com/dashboard).
</Callout>

<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/my-api.json" />
```

Specra provides a powerful yet flexible system for documenting REST APIs. Whether you have 5 endpoints or 500, we've got you covered.

## Two Approaches

### 1. Auto-Generated Documentation

Perfect for large APIs or when you already have specs.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 not-prose my-6">
  <div className="border border-border rounded-lg p-4">
    <div className="text-2xl mb-2">📋</div>
    <h4 className="font-semibold mb-1">Specra Format</h4>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Simple JSON format</p>
  </div>
  <div className="border border-border rounded-lg p-4">
    <div className="text-2xl mb-2">🔧</div>
    <h4 className="font-semibold mb-1">OpenAPI 3.x</h4>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Industry standard</p>
  </div>
  <div className="border border-border rounded-lg p-4">
    <div className="text-2xl mb-2">📮</div>
    <h4 className="font-semibold mb-1">Postman v2.x</h4>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Export from Postman</p>
  </div>
</div>

Simply create or export your spec file and reference it:

```mdx
<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/my-api.json" />
```

The system **auto-detects** the format and generates beautiful, interactive documentation.

**Examples:**
- [Specra Format (JSONPlaceholder) →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-test)
- [OpenAPI 3.0 Format →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-openapi)
- [Postman Collection →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-postman)

### 2. Manual MDX Components

Perfect for small APIs or when you need custom layouts.

Use individual components to craft your documentation:

```mdx
<ApiEndpoint
  method="GET"
  path="/api/users/:id"
  summary="Get user by ID"
>
  <ApiParams params={[...]} />
  <ApiResponse status={200} example={{...}} />
  <ApiPlayground method="GET" path="/api/users/123" />
</ApiEndpoint>
```

**Example:**
- [Manual Component Example →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-example)

---

## Quick Start

### Auto-Generated (Recommended)

1. **Create your spec file** (Specra, OpenAPI, or Postman)
2. **Place it in** `/public/api-specs/my-api.json`
3. **Add to your MDX**:

```mdx
---
title: API Reference
---

# My API Documentation

<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/my-api.json" />
```

That's it! You now have:
- ✅ Auto-generated endpoint documentation
- ✅ Interactive API playground
- ✅ Collapsible accordion UI
- ✅ Syntax-highlighted examples
- ✅ Request/response schemas

### Manual Components

1. **Create an MDX file** in `docs/`
2. **Use API components**:

```mdx
---
title: API Reference
---

# My API

<ApiEndpoint method="GET" path="/users" summary="List users">
  <ApiParams
    title="Query Parameters"
    params={[
      { name: "page", type: "number", description: "Page number" }
    ]}
  />

  <ApiResponse
    status={200}
    description="Success"
    example={[{ id: 1, name: "John" }]}
  />

  <ApiPlayground
    method="GET"
    path="/users"
    baseUrl="https://api.example.com"
  />
</ApiEndpoint>
```

## Available Components

### `<ApiReference>`

Auto-generate docs from spec files.

```tsx
<ApiReference
  spec="/api-specs/my-api.json"  // Path to spec file
  parser="auto"                   // auto | specra | openapi | postman
  showPlayground={true}           // Show interactive playground
/>
```

### `<ApiEndpoint>`

Document a single endpoint (accordion-style).

```tsx
<ApiEndpoint
  method="GET"              // GET | POST | PUT | PATCH | DELETE
  path="/api/users/:id"     // API path
  summary="Get user by ID"  // Short description
  defaultOpen={false}       // Start expanded?
>
  {/* Child components */}
</ApiEndpoint>
```

### `<ApiParams>`

Display parameters (path, query, body).

```tsx
<ApiParams
  title="Path Parameters"
  params={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      description: "User ID",
      example: "user_123"
    }
  ]}
/>
```

### `<ApiResponse>`

Show response examples.

```tsx
<ApiResponse
  status={200}
  description="User found"
  example={{
    id: "user_123",
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com"
  }}
/>
```

### `<ApiPlayground>`

Interactive API testing.

```tsx
<ApiPlayground
  method="GET"
  path="/users/:id"
  baseUrl="https://api.example.com"
  headers={{ "Authorization": "Bearer ..." }}
  pathParams={[
    { name: "id", type: "string", example: "user_123" }
  ]}
  defaultBody='{"key": "value"}'
/>
```

## Features

### Interactive Playground

Every endpoint includes a built-in playground where users can:
- ✅ Edit path parameters
- ✅ Modify request headers
- ✅ Update request body
- ✅ Send real API requests
- ✅ View formatted responses

### Accordion UI

Endpoints are collapsible by default, making it easy to:
- Browse many endpoints quickly
- Expand only what you need
- Keep the page clean and organized

### Syntax Highlighting

All code examples include:
- JSON syntax highlighting
- Line numbers
- Copy button
- Dark mode support

### Authentication

Document your auth requirements:
- Bearer tokens
- API keys
- Basic auth
- Custom headers

## Format Support

| Format | Version | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Specra** | 1.0 | Simple, custom format for any API |
| **OpenAPI** | 3.x, Swagger 2.0 | Industry standard, code generation |
| **Postman** | Collection v2.x | Postman users, quick export |

### OpenAPI Specification

Enterprise-grade API documentation:

[View OpenAPI Example →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-openapi)

### Postman Collection

Exported directly from Postman:

[View Postman Example →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-postman)

### Manual Components

Hand-crafted for custom needs:

[View Manual Example →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-example)

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Approach

**Use auto-generated** when:
- You have > 10 endpoints
- You already have a spec file
- You want consistency
- You need code generation

**Use manual components** when:
- You have < 10 endpoints
- You need custom layouts
- You want full control
- You're documenting gradually

### 2. Provide Examples

Always include realistic examples:
- Request bodies with actual data
- Response examples that match reality
- Edge cases and errors
- Authentication examples

### 3. Keep It Updated

**For auto-generated docs:**
- Regenerate specs when code changes
- Re-export Postman collections regularly
- Version your spec files

**For manual docs:**
- Review when API changes
- Test playground regularly
- Update examples

### 4. Organize by Feature

Group related endpoints:

```mdx
## User Management

<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/users.json" />

## Product Catalog

<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/products.json" />

## Orders

<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/orders.json" />
```

### 5. Add Context

Enhance with explanatory text:

```mdx
## Authentication

All endpoints require a valid JWT token.

<Callout type="info">
Get your API key from the [developer dashboard](https://example.com/dashboard).
</Callout>

<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/my-api.json" />
```

The Accordion component creates collapsible content sections, perfect for FAQs, expandable menus, or organizing large amounts of content.

## Usage

```mdx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="First Question" defaultOpen>
    This content is visible by default because of `defaultOpen`.
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="Second Question">
    This content is collapsed by default.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

## Live Example

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="What is an Accordion?" defaultOpen>
    An accordion is a UI pattern that allows users to expand and collapse sections of content. It's useful for organizing information in a compact, scannable format.
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="When should I use Accordions?">
    Use accordions when you have multiple sections of content that users may want to browse without scrolling through everything. Common use cases include FAQs, feature lists, and configuration options.
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="Can I have multiple items open?">
    Yes! By default, the Accordion allows multiple items to be open simultaneously. Each AccordionItem operates independently.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Props

### Accordion

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | required | AccordionItem components to render |
| `type` | `"single" \| "multiple"` | `"multiple"` | Whether one or multiple items can be open |

### AccordionItem

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `title` | `string` | required | The clickable header text |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | required | Content shown when expanded |
| `defaultOpen` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether the item starts expanded |

## Tips

<Callout type="tip">
Use the `defaultOpen` prop on the first AccordionItem to give users a preview of the content format.

# Configuration Overview

Specra uses a single configuration file, `specra.config.json`, located at your project root. This file controls everything from site metadata to navigation, theming, and deployment settings.

## Quick Start

Here's a minimal configuration to get started:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "My Documentation",
    "description": "Documentation for my project",
    "url": "https://docs.example.com"
  }
}
```

That's it! Specra fills in sensible defaults for everything else.

## Configuration Structure

The config file is organized into logical sections:

<CardGrid cols={2}>
  <Card
    icon="globe"
    title="Site Configuration"
    description="Basic site metadata, branding, and URLs"
    href="/docs/v1.0.0/configuration/site-config"
  />
  <Card
    icon="layout"
    title="Navigation"
    description="Sidebar, breadcrumbs, table of contents, and tab groups"
    href="/docs/v1.0.0/configuration/navigation"
  />
  <Card

    "target": "vercel",
    "basePath": "",
    "customDomain": false
  }
}
```

## TypeScript Support

For TypeScript projects, you can use `.ts` or `.mts` config files:

```typescript
// specra.config.ts
import type { SpecraConfig } from 'specra'

const config: SpecraConfig = {
  site: {
    title: 'My Documentation',
    description: 'Built with Specra',
  },
  // ... rest of config
}

export default config
```

## IDE Autocomplete

The config file includes a `$schema` property that enables autocomplete in VS Code and other editors:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/specra/config/specra.config.schema.json",
  "site": {
    // Autocomplete works here!
  }
}
```

When you type, your editor will suggest available options and show descriptions.

## Environment Variables

You can use environment variables in your config:

```json
{
  "search": {
    "meilisearch": {
      "host": "${MEILISEARCH_HOST}",
      "apiKey": "${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}"
    }
  }
}
```

Then set them:

```bash
# .env.local
MEILISEARCH_HOST=https://search.example.com
MEILISEARCH_API_KEY=your-key
```

<Callout type="warning">
Never commit sensitive API keys to version control. Use environment variables instead.
</Callout>

## Configuration Validation

Specra validates your config on startup and shows helpful errors if something's wrong:

```
❌ Configuration error in specra.config.json:
   - site.url must be a valid URL
   - navigation.tocMaxDepth must be between 1 and 6
```

Fix the errors and restart your dev server.

## Default Values

If you omit optional fields, Specra uses these defaults:

| Field | Default Value |
|-------|---------------|
| `site.baseUrl` | `"/"` |
| `site.language` | `"en"` |
| `theme.defaultMode` | `"system"` |
| `theme.respectPrefersColorScheme` | `true` |
| `navigation.showSidebar` | `true` |
| `navigation.collapsibleSidebar` | `true` |
| `navigation.showBreadcrumbs` | `true` |
| `navigation.showTableOfContents` | `true` |
| `navigation.tocPosition` | `"right"` |
| `navigation.tocMaxDepth` | `3` |
| `search.enabled` | `false` |
| `features.showLastUpdated` | `true` |
| `features.showReadingTime` | `true` |
| `features.versioning` | `true` |
| `deployment.target` | `"vercel"` |

## Multiple Environments

Create environment-specific configs:

```txt
├── specra.config.json          # Base config
├── specra.config.development.json
├── specra.config.staging.json
└── specra.config.production.json
```

Load the right one based on `NODE_ENV`:

```javascript
// Load config based on environment
const config = require(`./specra.config.${process.env.NODE_ENV}.json`)
```

}
```

## TypeScript Support

For TypeScript projects, you can use `.ts` or `.mts` config files:

```typescript
// specra.config.ts
import type { SpecraConfig } from 'specra'

const config: SpecraConfig = {
  site: {
    title: 'My Documentation',
    description: 'Built with Specra',
  },
  // ... rest of config
}

export default config
```

## IDE Autocomplete

The config file includes a `$schema` property that enables autocomplete in VS Code and other editors:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/specra/config/specra.config.schema.json",
  "site": {
    // Autocomplete works here!
  }
}
```

When you type, your editor will suggest available options and show descriptions.

## Environment Variables

You can use environment variables in your config:

```json
{
  "search": {
    "meilisearch": {
      "host": "${MEILISEARCH_HOST}",
      "apiKey": "${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}"
    }
  }
}
```

Then set them:

```bash
# .env.local
MEILISEARCH_HOST=https://search.example.com
MEILISEARCH_API_KEY=your-key
```

<Callout type="warning">
Never commit sensitive API keys to version control. Use environment variables instead.
</Callout>

## Configuration Validation

Specra validates your config on startup and shows helpful errors if something's wrong:

```
❌ Configuration error in specra.config.json:
   - site.url must be a valid URL
   - navigation.tocMaxDepth must be between 1 and 6
```

Fix the errors and restart your dev server.

## Default Values

If you omit optional fields, Specra uses these defaults:

| Field | Default Value |
|-------|---------------|
| `site.baseUrl` | `"/"` |
| `site.language` | `"en"` |
| `theme.defaultMode` | `"system"` |
| `theme.respectPrefersColorScheme` | `true` |
| `navigation.showSidebar` | `true` |
| `navigation.collapsibleSidebar` | `true` |
| `navigation.showBreadcrumbs` | `true` |
| `navigation.showTableOfContents` | `true` |
| `navigation.tocPosition` | `"right"` |
| `navigation.tocMaxDepth` | `3` |
| `search.enabled` | `false` |
| `features.showLastUpdated` | `true` |
| `features.showReadingTime` | `true` |
| `features.versioning` | `true` |
| `deployment.target` | `"vercel"` |

## Multiple Environments

Create environment-specific configs:

```txt
├── specra.config.json          # Base config
├── specra.config.development.json
├── specra.config.staging.json
└── specra.config.production.json
```

Load the right one based on `NODE_ENV`:

```javascript
// Load config based on environment
const config = require(`./specra.config.${process.env.NODE_ENV}.json`)
```

# create-specra

`create-specra` is the official CLI tool for scaffolding new Specra documentation sites. It sets up everything you need in seconds: project structure, dependencies, configuration, and sample content.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to create a new documentation site:

<Tabs defaultValue="npm">
  <Tab label="npm">
```bash
npx create-specra@latest my-docs
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="yarn">
```bash
yarn create specra my-docs
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm create specra my-docs
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This creates a new directory called `my-docs` with everything configured and ready to go.

## What Gets Created

When you run `create-specra`, here's what you get:

```txt
my-docs/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx              # Root layout with Specra setup
│   ├── page.tsx                # Landing page
│   ├── globals.css             # Global styles
│   └── docs/
│       └── [...slug]/
│           └── page.tsx        # Documentation page renderer
├── docs/
│   └── v1.0.0/
│       ├── about.mdx           # Sample about page
│       ├── getting-started.mdx # Sample getting started guide
│       └── components/         # Component examples
├── public/
│   ├── icon-light-32x32.png   # Favicon (light mode)
│   └── icon-dark-32x32.png    # Favicon (dark mode)
├── specra.config.json          # Specra configuration
├── package.json                # Dependencies and scripts
├── next.config.mjs             # Next.js configuration
├── tailwind.config.ts          # Tailwind CSS config
├── tsconfig.json               # TypeScript config
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

## Interactive Setup

When you run `create-specra`, it may prompt you for:

**Project name** (if not provided as argument)
```bash
npx create-specra@latest
# Prompts: What is your project named?
```

**Package manager preference** (if multiple are detected)
```bash
# Will ask: Which package manager do you want to use?
# Options: npm, yarn, pnpm
```

The CLI detects what's available on your system and suggests the best option.

## Command Options

### Basic Usage

```bash
npx create-specra@latest [project-name] [options]
```

### Examples

**Create with a specific name:**
```bash
npx create-specra@latest my-awesome-docs
```

**Create in current directory:**
```bash
npx create-specra@latest .
```

**Use a specific package manager:**
```bash
npx create-specra@latest my-docs --use-npm
npx create-specra@latest my-docs --use-yarn
npx create-specra@latest my-docs --use-pnpm
```

## What Happens Next

After scaffolding completes, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your project">
```bash
cd my-docs
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    The CLI doesn't auto-install dependencies. Run:

<Tabs defaultValue="npm">
  <Tab label="npm">
```bash
npm install
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="yarn">
```bash
yarn install
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm install
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the dev server">
<Tabs defaultValue="npm">
  <Tab label="npm">
```bash
npm run dev
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="yarn">
```bash
yarn dev
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm dev
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your site.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Default Configuration

The generated `specra.config.json` includes sensible defaults:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "My Documentation",
    "description": "Documentation site built with Specra",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "baseUrl": "/",
    "activeVersion": "v1.0.0"
  },
  "theme": {
    "defaultMode": "system",
    "respectPrefersColorScheme": true
  },
  "navigation": {
    "showSidebar": true,
    "collapsibleSidebar": true,
    "showBreadcrumbs": true,
    "showTableOfContents": true,
    "tocPosition": "right"
  },
  "features": {
    "showLastUpdated": true,
    "showReadingTime": true,
    "versioning": true
  },
  "deployment": {
    "target": "vercel"
  }
}
```

You can customize any of these settings. See [Configuration](/docs/v1.0.0/configuration/overview) for all available options.

## Sample Content

The scaffolded project includes sample documentation to help you get started:

**About page** - Example of a simple informational page
**Getting started** - Shows how to structure tutorials with steps
**Component examples** - Demonstrates all available MDX components

Feel free to delete or modify these pages. They're just there to show you what's possible.

## Available Scripts

The generated `package.json` includes these scripts:

| Script | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `dev` | `next dev` | Start development server with hot reload |
| `build` | `next build` | Build for production (Vercel, Node.js hosting) |
| `start` | `next start` | Start production server (after `build`) |
| `build:export` | `next build && next export` | Build static site (GitHub Pages, Netlify) |
| `lint` | `next lint` | Run ESLint to check code quality |

## Updating Specra

To update to the latest version of Specra in your project:

<Tabs defaultValue="npm">
  <Tab label="npm">
```bash
npm install specra@latest
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="yarn">
```bash
yarn upgrade specra@latest
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm update specra@latest
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
Check the [changelog](https://github.com/yourusername/specra/releases) for breaking changes before updating major versions.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If you get "command not found" errors:

**Check Node.js version:**
```bash
node --version
# Should be 18.0.0 or higher
```

**Try with full npx path:**
```bash
npx create-specra@latest my-docs
```

### Permission errors

On Linux/macOS, you might need to adjust npm permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER ~/.npm
```

Or use a node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Installation fails

If dependency installation fails:

1. Delete `node_modules` and lock file
2. Clear package manager cache
3. Try again

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a Specra site set up:

# Deployment Overview

Specra is built on Next.js, which means you can deploy it almost anywhere. This guide covers the most popular deployment options and how to configure Specra for each.

## Deployment Targets

Specra supports two deployment modes:

**Standalone Mode** (Node.js hosting)
- Vercel, Railway, Render, Fly.io, AWS, Google Cloud
- Dynamic server-side features
- Best performance with edge caching
- Default configuration

**Static Export** (Static hosting)
- GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages
- Pre-rendered HTML/CSS/JS
- No server required
- Great for open source docs

## Quick Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

The easiest deployment option. One click and you're live:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Push to GitHub">
    Push your project to a GitHub repository:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
git push -u origin main
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to Vercel">
    Visit [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and import your repository.

    Vercel automatically detects Next.js and uses the correct settings:
    - Build Command: `npm run build`
    - Output Directory: `.next`
    - Install Command: `npm install`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Done!">
    Your site deploys in under a minute. Vercel gives you a URL like `your-project.vercel.app`.

    Every git push to main triggers a new deployment automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
  No configuration needed! Specra's default settings work perfectly with Vercel.
</Callout>

### GitHub Pages

Perfect for open source documentation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure for Static Export">
    Update `specra.config.json`:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "github-pages",
    "basePath": "your-repo-name",
    "customDomain": false
  }
}
```

Replace `your-repo-name` with your actual repository name.

<Callout type="info">
  If using a custom domain (like `docs.yoursite.com`), set `customDomain: true` and leave `basePath` empty.
</Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Static Site">
```bash
npm run build:export
```

This creates an `out/` directory with your static site.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy with GitHub Actions">
    Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build site
        run: npm run build:export

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable GitHub Pages">
    1. Go to your repo settings
    2. Navigate to **Pages**
    3. Source: **GitHub Actions**
    4. Save

    Your docs will be live at `https://username.github.io/repo-name`
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Netlify

Another great static hosting option:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure">
```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "static"
  }
}
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create netlify.toml">
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build:export"
  publish = "out"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Connect your repo at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) or use the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Build Commands

Different platforms need different build commands:

| Platform | Build Command | Output Directory |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Vercel, Railway | `npm run build` | `.next` |
| GitHub Pages | `npm run build:export` | `out` |
| Netlify, Cloudflare Pages | `npm run build:export` | `out` |
| Docker, VPS | `npm run build` + `npm start` | `.next` |

## Configuration by Platform

### Vercel

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "vercel"
  }
}
```

**Environment variables** (optional):
- None required for basic setup
- Add search/analytics keys in Vercel dashboard

### GitHub Pages (No Custom Domain)

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "github-pages",
    "basePath": "repo-name"
  }
}
```

**Why basePath?** GitHub Pages serves from `username.github.io/repo-name`, so all assets need the `/repo-name` prefix.

### GitHub Pages (With Custom Domain)

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "custom-domain-static",
    "customDomain": true
  }
}
```

Add a `CNAME` file to `public/`:

```
docs.yoursite.com
```

### Netlify / Cloudflare Pages

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "static"
  }
}
```

No basePath needed - they serve from root.

## CI/CD Pipelines

### GitHub Actions (Advanced)

Full example with caching and MeiliSearch indexing:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Build site
        run: npm run build:export
        env:
          NODE_ENV: production

      - name: Index search content
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: npm run index:search
        env:
          MEILISEARCH_HOST: ${{ secrets.MEILISEARCH_HOST }}
          MEILISEARCH_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MEILISEARCH_MASTER_KEY }}

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  deploy:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### GitLab CI/CD

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
image: node:20

cache:
  paths:
    - node_modules/

stages:
  - build
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run build:export
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - out/
  only:
    - main

pages:
  stage: deploy
  dependencies:
    - build
  script:
    - mkdir -p public
    - cp -r out/* public/
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
  only:
    - main
```

### Docker

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine AS runner

WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV=production

COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t my-docs .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-docs
```

## Environment Variables

Set these in your deployment platform:

**Search (if using MeiliSearch):**
```bash
MEILISEARCH_HOST=https://search.example.com
MEILISEARCH_API_KEY=your-search-key
```

**Analytics (optional):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN=docs.example.com
```

**Custom env variables:**
Access them in your docs via frontmatter or MDX:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "API_BASE_URL": "${API_URL}"
  }
}
```

## Custom Domains

### Vercel

1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to Domains
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update DNS records as shown

### GitHub Pages

1. Add `CNAME` file to `public/`:
```
docs.yoursite.com
```

2. Update `specra.config.json`:
```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "customDomain": true
  }
}
```

3. Configure DNS:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: docs
Value: username.github.io
```

### Netlify

1. Go to Domain settings
2. Add custom domain
3. Follow DNS instructions

## Performance Optimization

### Enable Caching

Add cache headers in `next.config.mjs`:

```javascript
async headers() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/docs/:path*',
      headers: [
        {
          key: 'Cache-Control',
          value: 'public, max-age=3600, must-revalidate',
        },
      ],
    },
  ]
}
```

### Image Optimization

Use Next.js Image component:

```mdx
<Image
  src="/images/diagram.png"
  alt="Architecture diagram"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>
```

### Bundle Analysis

Check bundle size:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @next/bundle-analyzer
```

```javascript
// next.config.mjs
import bundleAnalyzer from '@next/bundle-analyzer'

const withBundleAnalyzer = bundleAnalyzer({
  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
})

export default withBundleAnalyzer(nextConfig)
```

Run with:
```bash
ANALYZE=true npm run build
```

## Troubleshooting

### 404 on Page Refresh (Static Export)

Add redirects/rewrites in platform config:

**Netlify:**
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

**Vercel (vercel.json):**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

### Assets Not Loading (GitHub Pages)

Check your `basePath` matches your repo name exactly:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "basePath": "exact-repo-name"
  }
}
```

### Build Fails

Common fixes:

1. Clear `.next` and `out` folders:
```bash
rm -rf .next out node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

2. Check Node.js version:
```bash
node --version  # Should be 18+
```

3. Review build logs for specific errors

# Deployment Overview

Specra is built on Next.js, which means you can deploy it almost anywhere. This guide covers the most popular deployment options and how to configure Specra for each.

## Deployment Targets

Specra supports two deployment modes:

**Standalone Mode** (Node.js hosting)
- Vercel, Railway, Render, Fly.io, AWS, Google Cloud
- Dynamic server-side features
- Best performance with edge caching
- Default configuration

**Static Export** (Static hosting)
- GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages
- Pre-rendered HTML/CSS/JS
- No server required
- Great for open source docs

## Quick Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

The easiest deployment option. One click and you're live:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Push to GitHub">
    Push your project to a GitHub repository:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
git push -u origin main
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to Vercel">
    Visit [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and import your repository.

    Vercel automatically detects Next.js and uses the correct settings:
    - Build Command: `npm run build`
    - Output Directory: `.next`
    - Install Command: `npm install`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Done!">
    Your site deploys in under a minute. Vercel gives you a URL like `your-project.vercel.app`.

    Every git push to main triggers a new deployment automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
  No configuration needed! Specra's default settings work perfectly with Vercel.
</Callout>

### GitHub Pages

Perfect for open source documentation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure for Static Export">
    Update `specra.config.json`:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "github-pages",
    "basePath": "your-repo-name",
    "customDomain": false
  }
}
```

Replace `your-repo-name` with your actual repository name.

<Callout type="info">
  If using a custom domain (like `docs.yoursite.com`), set `customDomain: true` and leave `basePath` empty.
</Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Static Site">
```bash
npm run build:export
```

This creates an `out/` directory with your static site.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy with GitHub Actions">
    Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build site
        run: npm run build:export

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable GitHub Pages">
    1. Go to your repo settings
    2. Navigate to **Pages**
    3. Source: **GitHub Actions**
    4. Save

    Your docs will be live at `https://username.github.io/repo-name`
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Netlify

Another great static hosting option:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure">
```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "static"
  }
}
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create netlify.toml">
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build:export"
  publish = "out"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Connect your repo at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) or use the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Build Commands

Different platforms need different build commands:

| Platform | Build Command | Output Directory |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Vercel, Railway | `npm run build` | `.next` |
| GitHub Pages | `npm run build:export` | `out` |
| Netlify, Cloudflare Pages | `npm run build:export` | `out` |
| Docker, VPS | `npm run build` + `npm start` | `.next` |

## Configuration by Platform

### Vercel

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "vercel"
  }
}
```

**Environment variables** (optional):
- None required for basic setup
- Add search/analytics keys in Vercel dashboard

### GitHub Pages (No Custom Domain)

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "github-pages",
    "basePath": "repo-name"
  }
}
```

**Why basePath?** GitHub Pages serves from `username.github.io/repo-name`, so all assets need the `/repo-name` prefix.

### GitHub Pages (With Custom Domain)

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "custom-domain-static",
    "customDomain": true
  }
}
```

Add a `CNAME` file to `public/`:

```
docs.yoursite.com
```

### Netlify / Cloudflare Pages

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "static"
  }
}
```

No basePath needed - they serve from root.

        },
      ],
    },
  ]
}
```

### Image Optimization

Use Next.js Image component:

```mdx
<Image
  src="/images/diagram.png"
  alt="Architecture diagram"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>
```

### Bundle Analysis

Check bundle size:

```bash

```

```javascript
// next.config.mjs
import bundleAnalyzer from '@next/bundle-analyzer'

const withBundleAnalyzer = bundleAnalyzer({
  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
})

export default withBundleAnalyzer(nextConfig)
```

Run with:
```bash
ANALYZE=true npm run build
```

## Troubleshooting

### 404 on Page Refresh (Static Export)

Add redirects/rewrites in platform config:

**Netlify:**
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

**Vercel (vercel.json):**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

### Assets Not Loading (GitHub Pages)

Check your `basePath` matches your repo name exactly:

```

### Build Fails

Common fixes:

1. Clear `.next` and `out` folders:
```bash
rm -rf .next out node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

2. Check Node.js version:
```bash
node --version  # Should be 18+
```

3. Review build logs for specific errors

## How It Works

The API documentation system uses **auto-detection** by default. Simply reference your spec file and the system automatically determines the format:

```mdx
<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/my-api.json" />
```

The parser will detect whether your file is:
- ✅ Specra format (native)
- ✅ OpenAPI 3.x or Swagger 2.0
- ✅ Postman Collection v2.0 or v2.1

## Format Comparison

| Feature | Specra | OpenAPI | Postman |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Easy to write** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Industry standard** | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Schema validation** | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| **Code generation** | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Examples** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Auto-generation** | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## Choosing a Format

### Use Specra Format When:

- 📝 Writing docs from scratch
- 🎯 Need a simple, minimal format
- 🚀 Want to get started quickly
- 📖 Documenting < 20 endpoints

**Example:**
```json
{
  "title": "My API",
  "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com",
  "endpoints": [...]
}
```

---

### Use OpenAPI When:

- 🏢 Following enterprise standards
- 🔧 Generating specs from code
- 🔄 Sharing specs across tools
- 📊 Need detailed schema validation
- 🌐 Working with API gateways

**Example:**
```json
{
  "openapi": "3.0.0",
  "info": {...},
  "paths": {...}
}
```

[View OpenAPI Example →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-openapi)

---

### Use Postman When:

- 🧪 Your team uses Postman for testing
- 💾 Have existing Postman collections
- 🔁 Want docs in sync with tests
- 📸 Need saved response examples
- ⚡ Want quick export workflow

**Example:**
```json
{
  "info": {
    "schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/..."
  },
  "item": [...]
}
```

[View Postman Example →](/docs/v1.0.0/api-postman)

## Workflow Examples

### Workflow 1: Start Simple (Specra)

Perfect for new projects or small APIs:

1. **Create a Specra JSON file** in `/public/api-specs/`
2. **Add your endpoints** with examples
3. **Reference in MDX**:
   ```mdx
   <ApiReference spec="/api-specs/my-api.json" />
   ```
4. **Done!** Interactive docs are live

---

### Workflow 2: Use Existing OpenAPI (OpenAPI)

Great if you're already using OpenAPI:

1. **Generate OpenAPI spec** from your code (e.g., FastAPI, Swagger, etc.)
2. **Place in `/public/api-specs/`**
3. **Reference in MDX**:
   ```mdx
   <ApiReference spec="/api-specs/openapi.json" />
   ```
4. **Keep in sync** by regenerating when code changes

---

### Workflow 3: Export from Postman (Postman)

Ideal for teams using Postman:

1. **Develop and test** your API in Postman
2. **Add response examples** in Postman
3. **Export collection** (v2.1 format)
4. **Place in `/public/api-specs/`**
5. **Reference in MDX**:
   ```mdx
   <ApiReference spec="/api-specs/collection.json" />
   ```
6. **Re-export** when you update your collection

## Mixed Approach

You can use multiple formats in the same project:

```mdx
<!-- Auto-generated OpenAPI for main API -->
<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/main-api-openapi.json" />

<!-- Postman collection for external API -->
<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/third-party-postman.json" />

<!-- Specra for internal tools -->
<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/internal-tools-specra.json" />
```

## Advanced Usage

### Explicit Parser Selection

While auto-detection works well, you can explicitly specify the parser:

```mdx
<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/my-api.json" parser="openapi" />
<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/my-api.json" parser="postman" />
<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/my-api.json" parser="specra" />
```

### Disable Playground

Turn off the interactive playground if you don't need it:

```mdx
<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/my-api.json" showPlayground={false} />
```

### Multiple Versions

Document multiple API versions:

```mdx
## Version 2.0 (Current)

<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/api-v2.json" />

## Version 1.0 (Deprecated)

<Callout type="warning">
This version will be sunset on June 1, 2024
</Callout>

<ApiReference spec="/api-specs/api-v1.json" showPlayground={false} />
```

## Common Features

Regardless of which format you choose, all specs support:

✅ **Path parameters** - Dynamic URL segments (`:id`, `{id}`)

✅ **Query parameters** - URL query strings

✅ **Request headers** - Custom headers

✅ **Request bodies** - JSON payloads

✅ **Response examples** - Sample responses

✅ **Multiple response codes** - 200, 404, 500, etc.

✅ **Authentication** - Bearer, API Key, Basic

✅ **Interactive playground** - Test APIs live

# Site Configuration

The `site` section in `specra.config.json` controls your documentation site's identity, branding, and basic metadata. This is where you define your site's title, description, logo, and other fundamental properties.

## Basic Configuration

Here's a minimal site configuration:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "My Documentation",
    "description": "Comprehensive documentation for my project",
    "url": "https://docs.example.com"
  }
}
```

That's all you need to get started. Specra fills in sensible defaults for everything else.

## All Site Options

### Required Fields

Only one field is truly required:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "My Documentation"
  }
}
```

Everything else is optional but recommended for a professional docs site.

### Complete Configuration

Here's every available option:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "Specra Documentation",
    "description": "Build beautiful documentation with Specra",
    "url": "https://docs.example.com",
    "baseUrl": "/",
    "language": "en",
    "organizationName": "My Company",
    "projectName": "specra",
    "activeVersion": "v1.0.0",
    "logo": "/logo.svg",
    "favicon": "/favicon.ico",
    "hideTitle": false,
    "hideLogo": false
  }
}
```

## Configuration Reference

### title

**Type:** `string` (Required)

The name of your documentation site. Appears in the browser tab, navigation header, and social media previews.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "Specra Docs"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="tip">
Keep it short and clear. This appears in many places, including browser tabs where space is limited.
</Callout>

### description

**Type:** `string`

Brief description of your documentation. Used in SEO meta tags and social media previews.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "description": "Complete guide to building documentation with Specra"
  }
}
```

**Best practices:**
- Keep it under 160 characters
- Include relevant keywords
- Be descriptive and specific
- Focus on what users will learn

### url

**Type:** `string`

The full URL where your documentation is hosted. Used for generating canonical URLs and social media previews.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "url": "https://docs.example.com"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
Include the protocol (`https://`) but no trailing slash.
</Callout>

### baseUrl

**Type:** `string`
**Default:** `"/"`

Base path for your site. Usually only needed for GitHub Pages without a custom domain.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "baseUrl": "/"
  }
}
```

For GitHub Pages at `username.github.io/repo-name`:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "baseUrl": "/repo-name/"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
For most deployments (Vercel, Netlify, custom domains), keep this as `"/"`.
</Callout>

### language

**Type:** `string`
**Default:** `"en"`

The primary language of your documentation. Used in the HTML `lang` attribute.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "language": "en"
  }
}
```

Common values: `en`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `ja`, `zh`, `pt`, `ru`

### organizationName

**Type:** `string`

Your company or organization name. Used in footer and metadata.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "organizationName": "Acme Corporation"
  }
}
```

### projectName

**Type:** `string`

The name of your project or product. Used in metadata and can be referenced in content.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "projectName": "specra"
  }
}
```

### activeVersion

**Type:** `string`
**Default:** First version found in `docs/` folder

Which documentation version to show by default.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "activeVersion": "v2.0.0"
  }
}
```

Users can switch versions using the version dropdown, but this sets the default.

### logo

**Type:** `string` or `object`

Path to your logo image. Can be a single logo or separate logos for light and dark modes.

**Single logo:**
```json
{
  "site": {
    "logo": "/logo.svg"
  }
}
```

**Separate logos for themes:**
```json
{
  "site": {
    "logo": {
      "light": "/logo-light.svg",
      "dark": "/logo-dark.svg"
    }
  }
}
```

**Best practices:**
- Use SVG for crisp rendering at any size
- Keep dimensions around 150px wide × 40px tall
- Optimize files (use SVGO or similar)
- Place in `public/` folder

### favicon

**Type:** `string`

Path to your favicon. Appears in browser tabs and bookmarks.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "favicon": "/favicon.ico"
  }
}
```

**Recommended setup:**
```
public/
├── favicon.ico          # 32×32 ICO for older browsers
├── favicon-16x16.png    # 16×16 PNG
├── favicon-32x32.png    # 32×32 PNG
└── apple-touch-icon.png # 180×180 PNG for iOS
```

Then reference the main one:
```json
{
  "site": {
    "favicon": "/favicon-32x32.png"
  }
}
```

### hideTitle

**Type:** `boolean`
**Default:** `false`

Hide the site title in the header navigation.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "hideTitle": true
  }
}
```

Useful when your logo includes text and you don't want the title duplicated.

### hideLogo

**Type:** `boolean`
**Default:** `false`

Hide the logo in the header navigation.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "hideLogo": true
  }
}
```

Use this if you only want to show the text title without a logo.

## Examples

### Minimal Setup

Perfect for getting started:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "My Docs",
    "description": "Documentation for my project"
  }
}
```

### Open Source Project

For an open source project on GitHub:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "MyLib Documentation",
    "description": "A powerful library for building awesome things",
    "url": "https://mylib.dev",
    "organizationName": "MyLib Contributors",
    "projectName": "mylib",
    "logo": "/logo.svg",
    "favicon": "/favicon.ico"
  }
}
```

### Company Product

For a commercial product:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "Acme API Docs",
    "description": "Complete API reference and guides for Acme Platform",
    "url": "https://docs.acme.com",
    "organizationName": "Acme Corporation",
    "projectName": "acme-platform",
    "activeVersion": "v2.0.0",
    "logo": {
      "light": "/acme-logo-light.svg",
      "dark": "/acme-logo-dark.svg"
    },
    "favicon": "/favicon-32x32.png"
  }
}
```

### Multi-Language Site

For documentation in multiple languages:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "Documentation",
    "language": "es",
    "url": "https://docs.example.com/es",
    "logo": "/logo.svg"
  }
}
```

## Common Patterns

### GitHub Pages Setup

For GitHub Pages without custom domain:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "My Docs",
    "url": "https://username.github.io/repo-name",
    "baseUrl": "/repo-name/"
  }
}
```

### Logo Best Practices

**For light mode background:**
Use a dark logo or logo with color

**For dark mode background:**
Use a light/white logo or invert colors

**Example setup:**
```json
{
  "site": {
    "logo": {
      "light": "/logo-dark.svg",
      "dark": "/logo-white.svg"
    }
  }
}
```

## Validation

Specra validates your site configuration on startup. Common errors:

**Missing title:**
```
❌ Error: site.title is required
```

**Invalid URL:**
```
❌ Error: site.url must be a valid URL (include https://)
```

**Logo file not found:**
```
⚠️ Warning: Logo file not found at /logo.svg
```

## Environment Variables

Use environment variables for different environments:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "url": "${SITE_URL}",
    "logo": "${LOGO_PATH}"
  }
}
```

Then set them:
```bash
# .env.local
SITE_URL=https://docs.example.com
LOGO_PATH=/logo.svg
```

    "description": "Comprehensive documentation for my project",
    "url": "https://docs.example.com"
  }
}
```

That's all you need to get started. Specra fills in sensible defaults for everything else.

## All Site Options

### Required Fields

Only one field is truly required:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "My Documentation"
  }
}
```

Everything else is optional but recommended for a professional docs site.

### Complete Configuration

Here's every available option:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "Specra Documentation",
    "description": "Build beautiful documentation with Specra",
    "url": "https://docs.example.com",
    "baseUrl": "/",
    "language": "en",
    "organizationName": "My Company",
    "projectName": "specra",
    "activeVersion": "v1.0.0",
    "logo": "/logo.svg",
    "favicon": "/favicon.ico",
    "hideTitle": false,
    "hideLogo": false
  }
}
```

## Configuration Reference

### title

**Type:** `string` (Required)

The name of your documentation site. Appears in the browser tab, navigation header, and social media previews.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "Specra Docs"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="tip">
Keep it short and clear. This appears in many places, including browser tabs where space is limited.
</Callout>

### description

**Type:** `string`

Brief description of your documentation. Used in SEO meta tags and social media previews.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "description": "Complete guide to building documentation with Specra"
  }
}
```

**Best practices:**
- Keep it under 160 characters
- Include relevant keywords
- Be descriptive and specific
- Focus on what users will learn

### url

**Type:** `string`

The full URL where your documentation is hosted. Used for generating canonical URLs and social media previews.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "url": "https://docs.example.com"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
Include the protocol (`https://`) but no trailing slash.
</Callout>

### baseUrl

**Type:** `string`
**Default:** `"/"`

Base path for your site. Usually only needed for GitHub Pages without a custom domain.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "baseUrl": "/"
  }
}
```

For GitHub Pages at `username.github.io/repo-name`:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "baseUrl": "/repo-name/"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
For most deployments (Vercel, Netlify, custom domains), keep this as `"/"`.
</Callout>

### language

**Type:** `string`
**Default:** `"en"`

The primary language of your documentation. Used in the HTML `lang` attribute.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "language": "en"
  }
}
```

Common values: `en`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `ja`, `zh`, `pt`, `ru`

### organizationName

**Type:** `string`

Your company or organization name. Used in footer and metadata.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "organizationName": "Acme Corporation"
  }
}
```

### projectName

**Type:** `string`

The name of your project or product. Used in metadata and can be referenced in content.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "projectName": "specra"
  }
}
```

### activeVersion

**Type:** `string`
**Default:** First version found in `docs/` folder

Which documentation version to show by default.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "activeVersion": "v2.0.0"
  }
}
```

Users can switch versions using the version dropdown, but this sets the default.

### logo

**Type:** `string` or `object`

Path to your logo image. Can be a single logo or separate logos for light and dark modes.

**Single logo:**
```json
{
  "site": {
    "logo": "/logo.svg"
  }
}
```

**Separate logos for themes:**
```json
{
  "site": {
    "logo": {
      "light": "/logo-light.svg",
      "dark": "/logo-dark.svg"
    }
  }
}
```

**Best practices:**
- Use SVG for crisp rendering at any size
- Keep dimensions around 150px wide × 40px tall
- Optimize files (use SVGO or similar)
- Place in `public/` folder

### favicon

**Type:** `string`

Path to your favicon. Appears in browser tabs and bookmarks.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "favicon": "/favicon.ico"
  }
}
```

**Recommended setup:**
```
public/
├── favicon.ico          # 32×32 ICO for older browsers
├── favicon-16x16.png    # 16×16 PNG
├── favicon-32x32.png    # 32×32 PNG
└── apple-touch-icon.png # 180×180 PNG for iOS
```

Then reference the main one:
```json
{
  "site": {
    "favicon": "/favicon-32x32.png"
  }
}
```

### hideTitle

**Type:** `boolean`
**Default:** `false`

Hide the site title in the header navigation.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "hideTitle": true
  }
}
```

Useful when your logo includes text and you don't want the title duplicated.

### hideLogo

**Type:** `boolean`
**Default:** `false`

Hide the logo in the header navigation.

```json
{
  "site": {
    "hideLogo": true
  }
}
```

Use this if you only want to show the text title without a logo.

## Examples

### Minimal Setup

Perfect for getting started:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "My Docs",
    "description": "Documentation for my project"
  }
}
```

### Open Source Project

For an open source project on GitHub:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "MyLib Documentation",
    "description": "A powerful library for building awesome things",
    "url": "https://mylib.dev",
    "organizationName": "MyLib Contributors",
    "projectName": "mylib",
    "logo": "/logo.svg",
    "favicon": "/favicon.ico"
  }
}
```

### Company Product

For a commercial product:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "Acme API Docs",
    "description": "Complete API reference and guides for Acme Platform",
    "url": "https://docs.acme.com",
    "organizationName": "Acme Corporation",
    "projectName": "acme-platform",
    "activeVersion": "v2.0.0",
    "logo": {
      "light": "/acme-logo-light.svg",
      "dark": "/acme-logo-dark.svg"
    },
    "favicon": "/favicon-32x32.png"
  }
}
```

### Multi-Language Site

For documentation in multiple languages:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "Documentation",
    "language": "es",
    "url": "https://docs.example.com/es",
    "logo": "/logo.svg"
  }
}
```

## Common Patterns

### GitHub Pages Setup

For GitHub Pages without custom domain:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "My Docs",
    "url": "https://username.github.io/repo-name",
    "baseUrl": "/repo-name/"
  }
}
```

### Logo Best Practices

**For light mode background:**
Use a dark logo or logo with color

**For dark mode background:**
Use a light/white logo or invert colors

**Example setup:**
```json
{
  "site": {
    "logo": {
      "light": "/logo-dark.svg",
      "dark": "/logo-white.svg"
    }
  }
}
```

## Validation

Specra validates your site configuration on startup. Common errors:

**Missing title:**
```
❌ Error: site.title is required
```

**Invalid URL:**
```
❌ Error: site.url must be a valid URL (include https://)
```

**Logo file not found:**
```
⚠️ Warning: Logo file not found at /logo.svg
```

## Environment Variables

Use environment variables for different environments:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "url": "${SITE_URL}",
    "logo": "${LOGO_PATH}"
  }
}
```

Then set them:
```bash
# .env.local
SITE_URL=https://docs.example.com
LOGO_PATH=/logo.svg
```

# Deploy to Vercel

Vercel is the easiest way to deploy your Specra documentation. It's built by the creators of Next.js, so everything works perfectly out of the box.

## Why Vercel?

- **Zero configuration** - Automatic detection and setup
- **Instant deployments** - Live in under 60 seconds
- **Automatic HTTPS** - SSL certificates included
- **Edge network** - Fast loading worldwide
- **Preview deployments** - Every git push gets a URL
- **Free tier** - Generous limits for documentation sites

## Quick Deploy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Push to GitHub">
    If you haven't already, push your project to GitHub:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
git push -u origin main
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import to Vercel">
    1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
    2. Click "Import Git Repository"
    3. Select your documentation repository
    4. Vercel auto-detects Next.js and configures everything

    No manual configuration needed!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click "Deploy" and wait about 30-60 seconds.

    You'll get a production URL like `your-project.vercel.app`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
That's it! Your documentation is now live with automatic HTTPS and global CDN.
</Callout>

## Configuration

Vercel automatically uses these settings for Next.js projects:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Build Command | `npm run build` |
| Output Directory | `.next` |
| Install Command | `npm install` |
| Node Version | 20.x (latest LTS) |

### Override Settings (Optional)

If you need custom settings, create `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "installCommand": "npm ci",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1"]
}
```

## Environment Variables

Add environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Project Settings">
    Click your project → Settings → Environment Variables
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Variables">
    Add your variables one by one:

```
MEILISEARCH_HOST=https://search.example.com
MEILISEARCH_API_KEY=your-search-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

<Callout type="tip">
Variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser. Keep sensitive keys without this prefix.
</Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Redeploy">
    Environment changes require a redeploy. Go to Deployments → Click the three dots → Redeploy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom Domain

Add your own domain to your Vercel project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Domain">
    1. Go to Project Settings → Domains
    2. Enter your domain (e.g., `docs.example.com`)
    3. Click "Add"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure DNS">
    Vercel shows you the DNS records to add. Typically:

**For subdomain (docs.example.com):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: docs
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

**For apex domain (example.com):**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Verification">
    DNS propagation takes 5 minutes to 48 hours (usually under an hour).

    Vercel automatically provisions an SSL certificate once DNS is verified.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Automatic Deployments

Every git push triggers a deployment:

**Production Deployments:**
- Commits to `main` branch deploy to production
- Updates your live site automatically

**Preview Deployments:**
- Commits to other branches get preview URLs
- Pull requests get unique URLs for testing
- Perfect for reviewing changes before merging

### Preview URLs

Each preview deployment gets a unique URL:

```
your-project-git-feature-branch-username.vercel.app
```

Share this with your team to review changes before going live.

## Deployment Settings

### Branch Configuration

Control which branches deploy:

1. Go to Settings → Git
2. Set Production Branch (usually `main`)
3. Enable/disable preview deployments for other branches

### Deployment Protection

Protect production deployments:

```json
{
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": true,
      "staging": "preview"
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

Vercel automatically optimizes your deployment:

- **Edge caching** - Static files cached globally
- **Image optimization** - Next.js Image component optimized automatically
- **Compression** - Gzip/Brotli compression enabled
- **HTTP/2** - Faster multiplexed connections

### Analytics

Enable Vercel Analytics for free:

1. Go to Analytics tab
2. Click "Enable Analytics"
3. Add the Analytics component to your layout

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Analytics />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## CI/CD Integration

Vercel acts as your CI/CD pipeline:

**What runs on every deployment:**
- `npm install` (dependencies)
- `npm run build` (Next.js build)
- Automatic checks and validations
- Deploy to edge network

### GitHub Integration

Vercel comments on pull requests with:
- Preview deployment URL
- Build logs
- Performance insights

### Build Logs

View detailed build logs:
1. Go to Deployments
2. Click any deployment
3. View the Building section for logs

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Check Node version:**
Ensure you're using Node 18+. Add to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Clear build cache:**
1. Go to Settings → General
2. Scroll to Build & Development Settings
3. Clear build cache

### Environment Variables Not Working

- Check variable names (case-sensitive)
- Prefix client-side variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- Redeploy after changing variables

### Custom Domain Not Working

- Verify DNS records are correct
- Wait for DNS propagation (check with `dig` or `nslookup`)
- Ensure CNAME points to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
- Check domain verification status in Vercel dashboard

## Monorepo Deployment

If your docs are in a monorepo:

1. Set Root Directory in project settings
2. Point to your docs folder (e.g., `apps/docs`)
3. Vercel builds only that directory

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd ../.. && npm run build:docs",
  "outputDirectory": ".next"
}
```

## Best Practices

**Use preview deployments** - Test changes before merging to main

**Enable branch protection** - Require preview deployment success before merging

**Set up notifications** - Get Slack/email alerts for deployment status

**Monitor analytics** - Track page views and performance

**Use edge config** - Store feature flags and config at the edge for instant updates

## Pricing

Vercel's free tier includes:
- Unlimited deployments
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- Automatic HTTPS
- Preview deployments
- Analytics (basic)

This is usually enough for documentation sites. Upgrade to Pro if you need:
- More bandwidth
- Advanced analytics
- Password protection
- Enterprise support

# Getting Started with Specra

This guide will get you from zero to a fully functional documentation site in under 5 minutes. We'll cover installation, basic configuration, and writing your first page.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- **Node.js 18 or higher** (check with `node --version`)
- A package manager: **npm** (comes with Node.js), **yarn**, or **pnpm**
- A code editor (VS Code recommended for MDX support)

## Installation

The fastest way to get started is using `create-specra`, our scaffolding tool that sets up everything for you.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Project">
    Run the create command with your project name:

    <Tabs defaultValue="npm">
      <Tab label="npm">
```bash
npx create-specra@latest my-docs
```
      </Tab>
      <Tab label="yarn">
```bash
yarn create specra my-docs
```

## Project Structure

After running `create-specra`, here's what you get:

```

<Callout type="info">
**Important:** All documentation files must use the `.mdx` extension, not `.md`. MDX lets you use React components alongside Markdown.
</Callout>

## Your First Documentation Page

Let's create your first custom documentation page.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New File">
    Inside `docs/v1.0.0/`, create a file called `hello.mdx`:

```mdx
---
title: Hello Specra
description: My first documentation page
sidebar_position: 3
---

# Hello Specra!

This is my first documentation page. I can use **bold text**,
*italic text*, and even [links](https://specra.dev).

## Features I Love

- Fast hot reload
- Beautiful components
- Simple file structure
- Zero configuration needed
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Your Page">
    Save the file and visit [http://localhost:3000/docs/v1.0.0/hello](http://localhost:3000/docs/v1.0.0/hello)

    You should see your new page in the sidebar and rendered beautifully in the main content area.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Component">
    Let's make it more interesting with a Callout component:

```mdx
---
title: Hello Specra
description: My first documentation page
sidebar_position: 3
---

# Hello Specra!

This is my first documentation page.

<Callout type="success">
  I just added an interactive component to my Markdown! No imports needed.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

Ready to learn more? Check out the [Components](/docs/v1.0.0/components) section.
```

    Save and watch it update instantly. Notice how you didn't need to import the Callout component - it's automatically available in all your MDX files.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Frontmatter

Frontmatter is the metadata at the top of each MDX file, wrapped in triple dashes (`---`). It controls how your page appears and behaves.

### Available Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | string | ✅ Yes | Page title shown in sidebar, browser tab, and breadcrumbs |
| `description` | string | Recommended | Brief description for SEO and social media previews |
| `sidebar_position` | number | No | Controls sidebar order (lower numbers appear first) |
| `tab_group` | string | No | Assigns page to a tab group (like "guides", "api", "components") |
| `icon` | string | No | Lucide icon name to display next to title in sidebar |
| `tags` | array | No | Tags for categorization and filtering |
| `draft` | boolean | No | Set to `true` to hide page in production builds |
| `last_updated` | string | No | Override auto-detected last updated date |

### Example Frontmatter

```mdx
---
title: Advanced Configuration
description: Deep dive into Specra configuration options
sidebar_position: 10
tab_group: guides
icon: settings
tags: [configuration, advanced, customization]
draft: false
---

# Your content starts here
```

<Callout type="tip">
Pages without `sidebar_position` are sorted alphabetically. Use this field to create a specific reading order.
</Callout>

## Organizing with Folders

Group related pages into folders for better organization. Specra automatically generates navigation from your folder structure.

### Basic Folder Structure

```txt
docs/v1.0.0/
├── getting-started.mdx
├── guides/
│   ├── installation.mdx
│   ├── configuration.mdx
│   └── deployment.mdx
└── api/
    ├── overview.mdx
    └── endpoints.mdx
```

Each folder becomes a collapsible section in the sidebar.

### Category Configuration

Create a `_category_.json` file inside any folder to customize how it appears:

```json
{
  "label": "User Guides",
  "position": 2,
  "collapsible": true,
  "collapsed": false,
  "tab_group": "guides",
  "icon": "book-open"
}
```

**Options:**
- `label`: Display name in sidebar (defaults to folder name)
- `position`: Order among other folders/pages
- `collapsible`: Whether users can collapse the section
- `collapsed`: Initial collapsed state
- `tab_group`: Assign entire folder to a tab group
- `icon`: Lucide icon name

### Index Pages

Create an `index.mdx` file in a folder to provide a landing page when users click the folder name:

```txt
guides/
├── _category_.json
├── index.mdx          ← Landing page for /docs/v1.0.0/guides
├── installation.mdx
└── deployment.mdx
```

## Using Components

Specra comes with a rich library of components that are automatically available in all MDX files. No imports needed.

### Quick Examples

**Callouts for important information:**
```mdx
<Callout type="info">
  This is helpful information for your readers.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Be careful with this setting!
</Callout>
```

**Tabs for multiple options:**
```mdx
<Tabs defaultValue="npm">
  <Tab label="npm">
    npm install specra
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="yarn">
    yarn add specra
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

**Steps for tutorials:**
```mdx
<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Do this first.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    Then do this.
  </Step>
</Steps>
```

**Cards for visual navigation:**
```mdx
<CardGrid cols={2}>
  <Card
    icon="zap"
    title="Quick Start"
    description="Get up and running fast"
    href="/docs/v1.0.0/getting-started"
  />
  <Card
    icon="book"
    title="Full Guide"
    description="Complete documentation"
    href="/docs/v1.0.0/guides"
  />
</CardGrid>
```

Explore all available components in the [Components](/docs/v1.0.0/components) section.

## Markdown Support

Specra supports all standard Markdown syntax plus GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions.

**Headings:** `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.
**Bold:** `**text**` or `__text__`
**Italic:** `*text*` or `_text_`
**Links:** `[text](url)`
**Images:** `![alt](url)`
**Code:** `` `inline code` ``
**Code blocks:** Triple backticks with language

**Tables:**
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   |
```

**Task lists:**
```markdown
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Pending task
```

**Blockquotes:**
```markdown
> This is a quote
```

# Getting Started with Specra

This guide will get you from zero to a fully functional documentation site in under 5 minutes. We'll cover installation, basic configuration, and writing your first page.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- **Node.js 18 or higher** (check with `node --version`)
- A package manager: **npm** (comes with Node.js), **yarn**, or **pnpm**
- A code editor (VS Code recommended for MDX support)

## Installation

The fastest way to get started is using `create-specra`, our scaffolding tool that sets up everything for you.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Project">
    Run the create command with your project name:

    <Tabs defaultValue="npm">
      <Tab label="npm">
```bash
npx create-specra@latest my-docs
```
      </Tab>
      <Tab label="yarn">
```bash
yarn create specra my-docs
```
      </Tab>
      <Tab label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm create specra my-docs
```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    This creates a new directory called `my-docs` with all the files you need to get started.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate and Install">
    Move into your new project and install dependencies:

    <Tabs defaultValue="npm">
      <Tab label="npm">
```bash
cd my-docs
npm install
```
      </Tab>
      <Tab label="yarn">
```bash
cd my-docs
yarn install
```
      </Tab>
      <Tab label="pnpm">
```bash
cd my-docs
pnpm install
```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Installation typically takes 30-60 seconds depending on your internet connection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Dev Server">
    Fire up the development server:

    <Tabs defaultValue="npm">
      <Tab label="npm">
```bash
npm run dev
```
      </Tab>
      <Tab label="yarn">
```bash
yarn dev
```
      </Tab>
      <Tab label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm dev
```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You should see your documentation site with sample content!

    <Callout type="success">
    The dev server includes hot reload. Edit any MDX file and watch your changes appear instantly.

# Navigation Configuration

The `navigation` section controls how users move through your documentation. Configure the sidebar, breadcrumbs, table of contents, and tab groups to create an intuitive navigation experience.

## Basic Configuration

Here's a minimal navigation setup:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "showSidebar": true,
    "showBreadcrumbs": true,
    "showTableOfContents": true
  }
}
```

Specra provides sensible defaults, so you only need to configure what you want to change.

## Complete Configuration

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "showSidebar": true,
    "collapsibleSidebar": true,
    "showBreadcrumbs": true,
    "showTableOfContents": true,
    "tocPosition": "right",
    "tocMaxDepth": 3,
    "tabGroups": [
      {
        "id": "guides",
        "label": "Guides",
        "icon": "book-open"
      },
      {
        "id": "api",
        "label": "API Reference",
        "icon": "zap"
      },
      {
        "id": "components",
        "label": "Components",
        "icon": "layers"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Sidebar Configuration

### showSidebar

**Type:** `boolean`
**Default:** `true`

Show or hide the sidebar navigation.

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "showSidebar": true
  }
}
```

Set to `false` to hide the sidebar completely. Useful for landing pages or marketing sites.

### collapsibleSidebar

**Type:** `boolean`
**Default:** `true`

Allow users to collapse and expand sidebar sections.

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "collapsibleSidebar": true
  }
}
```

When `true`, folder sections have collapse/expand arrows. When `false`, all sections are always expanded.

## Breadcrumbs

### showBreadcrumbs

**Type:** `boolean`
**Default:** `true`

Display breadcrumb navigation at the top of each page.

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "showBreadcrumbs": true
  }
}
```

Breadcrumbs show the page's location in the documentation hierarchy:

```
Home > Guides > Getting Started
```

<Callout type="tip">
Breadcrumbs help users understand where they are and navigate back to parent sections.
</Callout>

## Table of Contents

### showTableOfContents

**Type:** `boolean`
**Default:** `true`

Display the table of contents (TOC) on documentation pages.

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "showTableOfContents": true
  }
}
```

The TOC shows all headings on the current page with links to scroll to each section.

### tocPosition

**Type:** `"left"` or `"right"`
**Default:** `"right"`

Position the table of contents on the left or right side of the page.

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tocPosition": "right"
  }
}
```

**Right position (default):**
- TOC appears in the right sidebar
- Traditional documentation layout
- More reading space for content

**Left position:**
- TOC appears in the left sidebar below main navigation
- Compact layout
- Less horizontal scrolling on smaller screens

### tocMaxDepth

**Type:** `number` (1-6)
**Default:** `3`

Maximum heading level to show in the table of contents.

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tocMaxDepth": 3
  }
}
```

**Options:**
- `1` - Only H1 headings
- `2` - H1 and H2 headings
- `3` - H1, H2, and H3 headings (recommended)
- `4` - Up to H4
- `5` - Up to H5
- `6` - All headings

<Callout type="warning">
Setting this too high (5 or 6) can make the TOC cluttered. Most docs work best with 2 or 3.
</Callout>

## Tab Groups

Tab groups organize your documentation into logical sections with separate navigation tabs.

### Basic Tab Groups

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabGroups": [
      {
        "id": "guides",
        "label": "Guides",
        "icon": "book-open"
      },
      {
        "id": "api",
        "label": "API Reference",
        "icon": "zap"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Tab Group Properties

Each tab group has three properties:

**id** (required)
- Unique identifier for the tab group
- Used in page frontmatter: `tab_group: "guides"`
- Lowercase, no spaces

**label** (required)
- Display name shown in the tab
- Can include spaces and capitalization

**icon** (optional)
- Lucide icon name to display next to label
- Makes tabs more visual and scannable

### Assigning Pages to Tab Groups

In your MDX frontmatter, specify which tab group a page belongs to:

```mdx
---
title: Getting Started
tab_group: guides
---
```

Pages with the same `tab_group` value appear together under that tab.

### Common Tab Group Setups

**Documentation + API:**
```json
{
  "tabGroups": [
    {
      "id": "docs",
      "label": "Documentation",
      "icon": "book"
    },
    {
      "id": "api",
      "label": "API Reference",
      "icon": "code"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Guides + Components + API:**
```json
{
  "tabGroups": [
    {
      "id": "guides",
      "label": "Guides",
      "icon": "book-open"
    },
    {
      "id": "components",
      "label": "Components",
      "icon": "layers"
    },
    {
      "id": "api",
      "label": "API",
      "icon": "zap"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Multi-product documentation:**
```json
{
  "tabGroups": [
    {
      "id": "platform",
      "label": "Platform",
      "icon": "box"
    },
    {
      "id": "mobile",
      "label": "Mobile SDK",
      "icon": "smartphone"
    },
    {
      "id": "web",
      "label": "Web SDK",
      "icon": "monitor"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Sidebar Organization

### Automatic Generation

Specra automatically generates your sidebar from your file structure:

```txt
docs/v1.0.0/
├── getting-started.mdx        → Getting Started
├── installation.mdx           → Installation
└── guides/                    → Guides (folder)
    ├── basics.mdx            →   Basics
    └── advanced.mdx          →   Advanced
```

### Controlling Order

Use `sidebar_position` in frontmatter to control page order:

```mdx
---
title: Getting Started
sidebar_position: 1
---
```

Lower numbers appear first. Pages without positions are sorted alphabetically.

### Category Configuration

Customize folder appearance with `_category_.json`:

```json
{
  "label": "User Guides",
  "position": 2,
  "collapsible": true,
  "collapsed": false,
  "icon": "book-open"
}
```

See [Writing Content](/docs/v1.0.0/writing-content) for more on organizing content.

## Examples

### Minimal Setup

Just enable the basics:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "showSidebar": true,
    "showBreadcrumbs": true,
    "showTableOfContents": true
  }
}
```

### Clean Layout

TOC on left, deeper headings:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "showSidebar": true,
    "collapsibleSidebar": true,
    "showBreadcrumbs": true,
    "showTableOfContents": true,
    "tocPosition": "left",
    "tocMaxDepth": 4
  }
}
```

### Multi-Section Documentation

With tab groups for different audiences:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "showSidebar": true,
    "collapsibleSidebar": true,
    "showBreadcrumbs": true,
    "showTableOfContents": true,
    "tocPosition": "right",
    "tocMaxDepth": 3,
    "tabGroups": [
      {
        "id": "getting-started",
        "label": "Getting Started",
        "icon": "rocket"
      },
      {
        "id": "developers",
        "label": "Developers",
        "icon": "code"
      },
      {
        "id": "designers",
        "label": "Designers",
        "icon": "palette"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

**Use tab groups wisely** - Don't create too many. 3-5 tabs maximum works best.

**Choose descriptive labels** - Make it obvious what's in each tab or section.

**Pick appropriate icons** - Icons should reinforce the tab's purpose.

**Set tocMaxDepth appropriately** - Most docs work best with 2 or 3 levels.

**Keep sidebar collapsible** - Let users hide sections they don't need.

**Show breadcrumbs** - They help users navigate complex documentation.

# Navigation Configuration

The `navigation` section controls how users move through your documentation. Configure the sidebar, breadcrumbs, table of contents, and tab groups to create an intuitive navigation experience.

## Basic Configuration

Here's a minimal navigation setup:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "showSidebar": true,
    "showBreadcrumbs": true,
    "showTableOfContents": true
  }
}
```

Specra provides sensible defaults, so you only need to configure what you want to change.

## Complete Configuration

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "showSidebar": true,
    "collapsibleSidebar": true,
    "showBreadcrumbs": true,
    "showTableOfContents": true,
    "tocPosition": "right",
    "tocMaxDepth": 3,
    "tabGroups": [
      {
        "id": "guides",
        "label": "Guides",
        "icon": "book-open"
      },
      {
        "id": "api",
        "label": "API Reference",
        "icon": "zap"
      },
      {
        "id": "components",

  }
}
```

Set to `false` to hide the sidebar completely. Useful for landing pages or marketing sites.

### collapsibleSidebar

**Type:** `boolean`
**Default:** `true`

Allow users to collapse and expand sidebar sections.

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "collapsibleSidebar": true
  }
}

# Deploy to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages offers free hosting for static sites, making it perfect for open source documentation. Deploy directly from your repository with GitHub Actions.

## Why GitHub Pages?

- **Free hosting** - No cost for public repositories
- **Custom domains** - Use your own domain
- **HTTPS included** - Automatic SSL certificates
- **Git-based** - Deploy from your repository
- **Version control** - Full history of your docs
- **Community trust** - Familiar platform for developers

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository (public or private)
- Specra documentation project
- Git installed locally

## Configuration

First, configure Specra for static export.

### Without Custom Domain

For URLs like `username.github.io/repo-name`:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "github-pages",
    "basePath": "repo-name",
    "customDomain": false
  }
}
```

<Callout type="Warning">
The `basePath` must exactly match your repository name. GitHub Pages serves from `username.github.io/repo-name`, so all assets need this prefix.
</Callout>

### With Custom Domain

For custom domains like `docs.example.com`:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "custom-domain-static",
    "basePath": "",
    "customDomain": true
  }
}
```

Also create `public/CNAME` with your domain:

```
docs.example.com
```

## Deployment Methods

Choose your preferred deployment method:

### Method 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

Automatic deployment on every push to main.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Workflow File">
    Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build site
        run: npm run build:export
        env:
          NODE_ENV: production

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable GitHub Pages">
    1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
    2. Source: **GitHub Actions**
    3. Save

No need to select a branch - the workflow handles deployment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Push and Deploy">
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment"
git push
```

Your site deploys automatically! Check the Actions tab for progress.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

Deploy manually using the `gh-pages` package.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install gh-pages">
```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Deploy Script">
    Update `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "npm run build:export && gh-pages -d out"
  }
}
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
```bash
npm run deploy
```

This builds your site and pushes the `out` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable GitHub Pages">
    1. Go to Settings → Pages
    2. Source: Deploy from a branch
    3. Branch: `gh-pages` / `/ (root)`
    4. Save
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom Domain Setup

Use your own domain with GitHub Pages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add CNAME File">
    Create `public/CNAME`:

```
docs.example.com
```

Update config:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "custom-domain-static",
    "customDomain": true,
    "basePath": ""
  }
}
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure DNS">
    Add DNS records at your domain provider:

**For subdomain (docs.example.com):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: docs
Value: username.github.io
```

**For apex domain (example.com):**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153
Value: 185.199.109.153
Value: 185.199.110.153
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

<Callout type="tip">
Use a subdomain like `docs.example.com` - it's simpler than apex domain setup.
</Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable HTTPS">
    After DNS propagates (can take up to 24 hours):

1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Check "Enforce HTTPS"
3. GitHub automatically provisions an SSL certificate
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced GitHub Actions

### With Search Indexing

Index your docs in MeiliSearch during deployment:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build site
        run: npm run build:export

      - name: Index search
        run: npm run index:search
        env:
          MEILISEARCH_HOST: ${{ secrets.MEILISEARCH_HOST }}
          MEILISEARCH_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MEILISEARCH_MASTER_KEY }}

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out
```

Add secrets in Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.

### Deploy on Tag

Only deploy when you create a release tag:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'
```

Create and push a tag to deploy:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Multiple Environments

Deploy different branches to different GitHub Pages sites:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - staging

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ... build steps ...

      - name: Deploy to production
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4

      - name: Deploy to staging
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/staging'
        # Deploy to a different repo or branch
```

## Troubleshooting

### 404 Errors on Routes

Static exports don't support dynamic routing the same way. Ensure all routes are pre-rendered.

**Solution:** Add a 404.html that redirects to index:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=/" />
  </head>
  <body>
    Redirecting...
  </body>
</html>
```

### Assets Not Loading

Check your `basePath` configuration:

```bash
# View your site
open https://username.github.io/repo-name

# Check if assets load from
https://username.github.io/repo-name/_next/...
```

If assets 404, verify:
- `basePath` in config matches repo name exactly
- You're using `npm run build:export` not `npm run build`

### Custom Domain Not Working

**Check DNS propagation:**
```bash
dig docs.example.com
# Should show CNAME to username.github.io
```

**Check CNAME file:**
- Must be in `public/` folder
- Contains only your domain, no protocol
- No trailing slash

**Common issues:**
- DNS not propagated yet (wait up to 24 hours)
- CNAME file missing or incorrect
- Domain verification failed in GitHub settings

### Build Fails in Actions

**View logs:**
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click the failed workflow
3. Expand build step to see errors

**Common fixes:**
- Increase Node version in workflow
- Clear npm cache: `npm ci --cache .npm`
- Check for missing dependencies

## Performance Tips

### Enable Caching

Cache node_modules for faster builds:

```yaml
- name: Setup Node
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'npm'
```

### Optimize Images

Pre-optimize images before committing:

```bash
npm install -D imagemin-cli

# Optimize all images
npx imagemin public/images/* --out-dir=public/images
```

### Reduce Bundle Size

Check what's in your bundle:

```bash
npm install -D @next/bundle-analyzer

ANALYZE=true npm run build:export
```

## Limits

GitHub Pages has some limits:

- **Repository size:** 1GB recommended
- **Site size:** 1GB published site
- **Bandwidth:** 100GB/month soft limit
- **Builds:** 10 per hour

These limits are generous for documentation sites.

## Migration from Other Platforms

### From Vercel

1. Update `specra.config.json` deployment section
2. Run `npm run build:export` locally to test
3. Set up GitHub Actions workflow
4. Push to trigger deployment

### From Netlify

Same process as Vercel. The static output works on both platforms.

## Best Practices

**Use GitHub Actions** - Automatic deployment on every push

**Version your docs** - Use git tags for documentation versions

**Test locally** - Run `npm run build:export && npx serve out` before pushing

**Monitor builds** - Set up notifications for failed deployments

**Use custom domain** - Professional appearance and stable URLs

**Enable HTTPS** - Always enforce HTTPS for security

# Deploy to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages offers free hosting for static sites, making it perfect for open source documentation. Deploy directly from your repository with GitHub Actions.

## Why GitHub Pages?

- **Free hosting** - No cost for public repositories
- **Custom domains** - Use your own domain
- **HTTPS included** - Automatic SSL certificates
- **Git-based** - Deploy from your repository
- **Version control** - Full history of your docs
- **Community trust** - Familiar platform for developers

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository (public or private)
- Specra documentation project
- Git installed locally

## Configuration

First, configure Specra for static export.

### Without Custom Domain

For URLs like `username.github.io/repo-name`:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "github-pages",
    "basePath": "repo-name",
    "customDomain": false
  }
}
```

<Callout type="Warning">
The `basePath` must exactly match your repository name. GitHub Pages serves from `username.github.io/repo-name`, so all assets need this prefix.
</Callout>

### With Custom Domain

For custom domains like `docs.example.com`:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "custom-domain-static",
    "basePath": "",
    "customDomain": true
  }
}
```

Also create `public/CNAME` with your domain:

```
docs.example.com
```

## Deployment Methods

Choose your preferred deployment method:

### Method 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

Automatic deployment on every push to main.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Workflow File">
    Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build site
        run: npm run build:export
        env:
          NODE_ENV: production

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable GitHub Pages">
    1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
    2. Source: **GitHub Actions**
    3. Save

No need to select a branch - the workflow handles deployment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Push and Deploy">
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment"
git push
```

Your site deploys automatically! Check the Actions tab for progress.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

Deploy manually using the `gh-pages` package.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install gh-pages">
```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Deploy Script">
    Update `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "npm run build:export && gh-pages -d out"
  }
}
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
```bash
npm run deploy
```

This builds your site and pushes the `out` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable GitHub Pages">
    1. Go to Settings → Pages
    2. Source: Deploy from a branch
    3. Branch: `gh-pages` / `/ (root)`
    4. Save
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom Domain Setup

Use your own domain with GitHub Pages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add CNAME File">
    Create `public/CNAME`:

```
docs.example.com
```

Update config:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "custom-domain-static",
    "customDomain": true,
    "basePath": ""
  }
}
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure DNS">
    Add DNS records at your domain provider:

**For subdomain (docs.example.com):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: docs
Value: username.github.io
```

**For apex domain (example.com):**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153
Value: 185.199.109.153
Value: 185.199.110.153
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

<Callout type="tip">
Use a subdomain like `docs.example.com` - it's simpler than apex domain setup.
</Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable HTTPS">
    After DNS propagates (can take up to 24 hours):

1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Check "Enforce HTTPS"
3. GitHub automatically provisions an SSL certificate
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Writing Content in Specra

Specra uses MDX (Markdown + JSX) for documentation, giving you the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. This guide covers everything you need to write great documentation.

## MDX Basics

MDX files look like regular Markdown but let you use React components anywhere in your content.

### Standard Markdown

All standard Markdown syntax works as expected:

**Headings:**
```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

**Text formatting:**
```markdown
**Bold text**
*Italic text*
~~Strikethrough~~
`Inline code`
```

**Lists:**
```markdown
- Unordered list
- Another item
  - Nested item

1. Ordered list
2. Second item
   1. Nested ordered item
```

**Links and images:**
```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
![Alt text](/images/photo.png)
```

**Code blocks:**
````markdown
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!")
}
```
````

**Tables:**
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| More     | Info     | Here     |
```

**Blockquotes:**
```markdown
> This is a quote.
> It can span multiple lines.
```

**Horizontal rules:**
```markdown
---
```

## Using Components

Components are used with JSX syntax directly in your MDX:

```mdx
<Callout type="info">
  This is a callout component!
</Callout>
```

All components are automatically available - no imports needed.

### Component Examples

**Alert readers to important information:**
```mdx
<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to backup your data before proceeding.
</Callout>
```

**Create tabbed content:**
```mdx
<Tabs defaultValue="option1">
  <Tab label="Option 1">
    Content for the first tab
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Option 2">
    Content for the second tab
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

**Guide users through steps:**
```mdx
<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Run `npm install` to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your app">
    Edit the config file with your settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>
```

See the [Components](/docs/v1.0.0/components) section for all available components.

## Content Organization

### File Structure Best Practices

Organize files logically to make content easy to find:

```txt
docs/v1.0.0/
├── getting-started.mdx         # Top level: essential pages
├── installation.mdx
├── guides/                     # Group related content
│   ├── _category_.json
│   ├── basics.mdx
│   ├── advanced.mdx
│   └── examples/              # Further nesting for sub-topics
│       ├── _category_.json
│       ├── example-1.mdx
│       └── example-2.mdx
└── api/
    ├── _category_.json
    └── reference.mdx
```

**Tips:**
- Keep the top level for critical pages users need first
- Use folders to group related content
- Limit nesting to 2-3 levels max
- Name files descriptively (`authentication.mdx` not `auth.mdx`)

### Controlling Page Order

Use `sidebar_position` in frontmatter to control ordering:

```mdx
---
title: Installation
sidebar_position: 1
---
```

Lower numbers appear first. Pages without a position are sorted alphabetically.

For folders, use `_category_.json`:

```json
{
  "label": "Getting Started",
  "position": 1
}
```

## Writing Style Tips

Good documentation is clear, concise, and helpful. Here are some tips:

### Be Clear and Direct

**Good:**
> Click the "Save" button to save your changes.

**Bad:**
> You might want to consider clicking on the button labeled "Save" if you would like to persist your modifications to storage.

### Use Active Voice

**Good:**
> The system validates your input.

**Bad:**
> Your input is validated by the system.

### Show, Don't Just Tell

Include examples with every concept:

```mdx
## Using Environment Variables

Access environment variables in your config:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "API_URL": "https://api.example.com"
  }
}
```

Then reference them in your MDX:

```mdx
The API is available at {process.env.API_URL}
```
```

### Break Up Long Content

Use headings, lists, callouts, and components to create visual breaks:

```mdx
## Configuration Options

There are several ways to configure authentication:

### API Keys

API keys are simple but less secure.

<Callout type="warning">
  Never commit API keys to version control.
</Callout>

### OAuth 2.0

OAuth provides better security for user-facing apps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register your app">
    Create an app in the provider dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure callback URL">
    Set your redirect URI in the app settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>
```

## Working with Images

### Adding Images

Place images in the `public/` folder:

```txt
public/
├── images/
│   ├── screenshot.png
│   └── diagram.svg
```

Reference them in MDX:

```mdx
![Dashboard screenshot](/images/screenshot.png)
```

### Image Best Practices

**Use descriptive alt text:**
```mdx
![Login form showing email and password fields](/images/login.png)
```

**Optimize image sizes:**
- Use WebP format when possible
- Compress images before adding to repo
- Keep images under 500KB

**Use the Image component for advanced features:**
```mdx
<Image
  src="/images/hero.png"
  alt="Hero image"
  caption="The main dashboard view"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>
```

## Code Examples

### Syntax Highlighting

Specify the language after the opening backticks:

````markdown
```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, world!"
console.log(greeting)
```

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

```bash
npm install specra
```
````

Supported languages include: javascript, typescript, python, bash, json, yaml, markdown, html, css, and many more.

### Highlighting Lines

Highlight specific lines to draw attention:

````markdown
```javascript {2,4-6}
function calculateTotal(items) {
  const subtotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0)
  const tax = subtotal * 0.1
  const shipping = 5.99
  const total = subtotal + tax + shipping
  return total
}
```
````

### File Names

Show which file the code belongs to:

````markdown
```javascript title="src/utils.js"
export function formatDate(date) {
  return date.toLocaleDateString()
}
```
````

### Use the CodeBlock Component

For more control:

```mdx
<CodeBlock
  language="javascript"
  title="src/app.js"
  highlightLines={[3, 5]}
  showLineNumbers={true}
>
{`function app() {
  const config = loadConfig()
  const server = createServer(config)
  server.listen(3000)
  console.log("Server running")
}`}
</CodeBlock>
```

## Links and Navigation

### Internal Links

Link to other pages in your docs:

```mdx
See the [Configuration guide](/docs/v1.0.0/configuration/overview) for details.
```

Use relative paths from the site root, including the version.

### External Links

External links open in a new tab automatically:

```mdx
Check out the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).
```

### Anchor Links

Link to headings on the same page:

```mdx
Jump to [Installation](#installation) below.
```

Heading anchors are auto-generated from the heading text in lowercase with hyphens.

## Frontmatter Reference

Every MDX file needs frontmatter. Here's a complete example:

```mdx
---
title: Advanced Topics
description: Deep dive into advanced Specra features
sidebar_position: 10
tab_group: guides
icon: zap
tags: [advanced, configuration, optimization]
draft: false
---

# Your content starts here
```

**Required fields:**
- `title`: Page title

**Recommended fields:**
- `description`: SEO description (150-160 characters)

**Optional fields:**
- `sidebar_position`: Number for sidebar ordering
- `tab_group`: Assign to a tab group
- `icon`: Lucide icon name
- `tags`: Array of tags
- `draft`: Hide in production if true

## Advanced MDX Features

### Importing Components

While built-in components work automatically, you can import custom ones:

```mdx
import { MyCustomComponent } from '@/components/custom'

<MyCustomComponent data="example" />
```

### Using JavaScript Expressions

Embed JavaScript expressions:

```mdx
The current year is {new Date().getFullYear()}.
```

### Conditional Content

Use JavaScript for conditional rendering:

```mdx
{process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && (
  <Callout type="info">
    You're viewing the development version.
  </Callout>
)}
```

## Version Management

When you need multiple doc versions:

```txt
docs/
├── v1.0.0/
│   └── getting-started.mdx
├── v2.0.0/
│   └── getting-started.mdx
└── next/
    └── getting-started.mdx
```

Set the active version in `specra.config.json`:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "activeVersion": "v2.0.0"
  }
}
```

Users can switch versions with the version dropdown in the UI.

## SEO Best Practices

### Page Titles and Descriptions

Always include both in frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: Getting Started with Specra
description: Learn how to install and configure Specra for your documentation needs
---
```

### Descriptive Headings

Use clear, descriptive headings that include keywords:

**Good:**
```markdown
## Installing Specra with npm
```

**Bad:**
```markdown
## Installation
```

### Structured Content

Use proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3). Never skip levels.

## Common Patterns

### Prerequisites Section

Start tutorials with prerequisites:

```mdx
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js 18 or higher
- A text editor
- Basic knowledge of Markdown
```

### Step-by-Step Tutorials

Use the Steps component:

```mdx
<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the package">
    Run npm install specra
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    Create a specra.config.json file
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the server">
    Run npm run dev
  </Step>
</Steps>
```

### Code with Explanation

Pair code examples with explanations:

```mdx
Configure your site title and description:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "title": "My Docs",
    "description": "Documentation for my project"
  }
}
```

The `title` appears in the browser tab and navigation. The `description` is used for SEO meta tags.
```

### Quick Reference Cards

Use CardGrid for scannable reference sections:

```mdx
<CardGrid cols={3}>
  <Card icon="terminal" title="CLI" description="Command line tools" href="/cli" />
  <Card icon="book" title="Guides" description="Step-by-step tutorials" href="/guides" />
  <Card icon="code" title="API" description="API reference docs" href="/api" />
</CardGrid>
```

# Writing Content in Specra

Specra uses MDX (Markdown + JSX) for documentation, giving you the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. This guide covers everything you need to write great documentation.

## MDX Basics

MDX files look like regular Markdown but let you use React components anywhere in your content.

### Standard Markdown

All standard Markdown syntax works as expected:

**Headings:**
```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

**Text formatting:**
```markdown
**Bold text**
*Italic text*
~~Strikethrough~~
`Inline code`
```

**Lists:**
```markdown
- Unordered list
- Another item
  - Nested item

1. Ordered list
2. Second item
   1. Nested ordered item
```

**Links and images:**
```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
![Alt text](/images/photo.png)
```

**Code blocks:**
````markdown
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!")
}
```
````

**Tables:**
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| More     | Info     | Here     |
```

**Blockquotes:**
```markdown
> This is a quote.
> It can span multiple lines.
```

**Horizontal rules:**
```markdown
---
```

## Using Components

Components are used with JSX syntax directly in your MDX:

```mdx
<Callout type="info">
  This is a callout component!
</Callout>
```

All components are automatically available - no imports needed.

### Component Examples

**Alert readers to important information:**
```mdx
<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to backup your data before proceeding.
</Callout>
```

**Create tabbed content:**
```mdx
<Tabs defaultValue="option1">
  <Tab label="Option 1">
    Content for the first tab
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Option 2">
    Content for the second tab
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

**Guide users through steps:**
```mdx
<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Run `npm install` to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your app">
    Edit the config file with your settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>
```

See the [Components](/docs/v1.0.0/components) section for all available components.

## Content Organization

### File Structure Best Practices

Organize files logically to make content easy to find:

```txt
docs/v1.0.0/
├── getting-started.mdx         # Top level: essential pages
├── installation.mdx
├── guides/                     # Group related content
│   ├── _category_.json
│   ├── basics.mdx
│   ├── advanced.mdx
│   └── examples/              # Further nesting for sub-topics
│       ├── _category_.json
│       ├── example-1.mdx
│       └── example-2.mdx
└── api/
    ├── _category_.json
    └── reference.mdx
```

**Tips:**
- Keep the top level for critical pages users need first
- Use folders to group related content
- Limit nesting to 2-3 levels max
- Name files descriptively (`authentication.mdx` not `auth.mdx`)

### Controlling Page Order

Use `sidebar_position` in frontmatter to control ordering:

```mdx
---
title: Installation
sidebar_position: 1
---
```

Lower numbers appear first. Pages without a position are sorted alphabetically.

For folders, use `_category_.json`:

```json
{
  "label": "Getting Started",
  "position": 1
}
```

## Writing Style Tips

Good documentation is clear, concise, and helpful. Here are some tips:

### Be Clear and Direct

**Good:**
> Click the "Save" button to save your changes.

**Bad:**
> You might want to consider clicking on the button labeled "Save" if you would like to persist your modifications to storage.

### Use Active Voice

**Good:**
> The system validates your input.

**Bad:**
> Your input is validated by the system.

### Show, Don't Just Tell

Include examples with every concept:

```mdx
## Using Environment Variables

Access environment variables in your config:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "API_URL": "https://api.example.com"
  }
}
```

Then reference them in your MDX:

```mdx
The API is available at {process.env.API_URL}
```
```

### Break Up Long Content

Use headings, lists, callouts, and components to create visual breaks:

```mdx
## Configuration Options

There are several ways to configure authentication:

### API Keys

API keys are simple but less secure.

<Callout type="warning">
  Never commit API keys to version control.
</Callout>

### OAuth 2.0

OAuth provides better security for user-facing apps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register your app">
    Create an app in the provider dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure callback URL">
    Set your redirect URI in the app settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>
```

## Working with Images

### Adding Images

Place images in the `public/` folder:

```txt
public/
├── images/
│   ├── screenshot.png
│   └── diagram.svg
```

Reference them in MDX:

```mdx
![Dashboard screenshot](/images/screenshot.png)
```

### Image Best Practices

**Use descriptive alt text:**
```mdx
![Login form showing email and password fields](/images/login.png)
```

**Optimize image sizes:**
- Use WebP format when possible
- Compress images before adding to repo
- Keep images under 500KB

**Use the Image component for advanced features:**
```mdx
<Image
  src="/images/hero.png"
  alt="Hero image"
  caption="The main dashboard view"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>
```

## Code Examples

### Syntax Highlighting

Specify the language after the opening backticks:

````markdown
```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, world!"
console.log(greeting)
```

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

```bash
npm install specra
```
````

Supported languages include: javascript, typescript, python, bash, json, yaml, markdown, html, css, and many more.

### Highlighting Lines

Highlight specific lines to draw attention:

````markdown
```javascript {2,4-6}
function calculateTotal(items) {
  const subtotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0)
  const tax = subtotal * 0.1
  const shipping = 5.99
  const total = subtotal + tax + shipping
  return total
}
```
````

### File Names

Show which file the code belongs to:

````markdown
```javascript title="src/utils.js"
export function formatDate(date) {
  return date.toLocaleDateString()
}
```
````

### Use the CodeBlock Component

For more control:

```mdx
<CodeBlock
  language="javascript"
  title="src/app.js"
  highlightLines={[3, 5]}
  showLineNumbers={true}
>
{`function app() {
  const config = loadConfig()
  const server = createServer(config)
  server.listen(3000)
  console.log("Server running")
}`}
</CodeBlock>
```

## Links and Navigation

### Internal Links

Link to other pages in your docs:

```mdx
See the [Configuration guide](/docs/v1.0.0/configuration/overview) for details.
```

Use relative paths from the site root, including the version.

### External Links

External links open in a new tab automatically:

```mdx
Check out the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).
```

### Anchor Links

Link to headings on the same page:

```mdx
Jump to [Installation](#installation) below.
```

Heading anchors are auto-generated from the heading text in lowercase with hyphens.

## Frontmatter Reference

Every MDX file needs frontmatter. Here's a complete example:

```mdx
---
title: Advanced Topics
description: Deep dive into advanced Specra features
sidebar_position: 10
tab_group: guides
icon: zap
tags: [advanced, configuration, optimization]
draft: false
---

# Your content starts here
```

**Required fields:**
- `title`: Page title

**Recommended fields:**
- `description`: SEO description (150-160 characters)

**Optional fields:**
- `sidebar_position`: Number for sidebar ordering
- `tab_group`: Assign to a tab group
- `icon`: Lucide icon name
- `tags`: Array of tags
- `draft`: Hide in production if true

# Deployment Configuration

The `deployment` section tells Specra how to build your documentation for different hosting platforms. This ensures assets load correctly and your site works wherever you deploy it.

## Why Deployment Configuration Matters

Different platforms serve your site from different URLs:

- **Vercel:** `yoursite.vercel.app` (serves from root `/`)
- **GitHub Pages (no custom domain):** `username.github.io/repo-name` (serves from `/repo-name/`)
- **Netlify:** `yoursite.netlify.app` (serves from root `/`)

Specra needs to know your deployment target to configure asset paths correctly.

## Basic Configuration

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "vercel"
  }
}
```

That's all you need for most deployments. Specra handles the rest automatically.

## Complete Configuration

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "vercel",
    "basePath": "",
    "customDomain": false
  }
}
```

## Configuration Options

### target

**Type:** `string`
**Default:** `"vercel"`

Your deployment platform. This determines which build process Specra uses.

**Available targets:**

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "vercel"
  }
}
```

**Options:**
- `"vercel"` - Vercel, Railway, Render, or any Node.js hosting
- `"github-pages"` - GitHub Pages without custom domain
- `"static"` - Static hosting (Netlify, Cloudflare Pages)
- `"custom-domain-static"` - GitHub Pages with custom domain

### basePath

**Type:** `string`
**Default:** `""`

Base path for your site. Only needed for GitHub Pages without a custom domain.

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "github-pages",
    "basePath": "my-repo"
  }
}
```

**When to use basePath:**

✅ **GitHub Pages without custom domain**
```
URL: username.github.io/my-repo
Config: "basePath": "my-repo"
```

❌ **GitHub Pages with custom domain**
```
URL: docs.example.com
Config: "basePath": ""
```

❌ **Vercel, Netlify, etc.**
```
URL: yoursite.vercel.app
Config: "basePath": ""
```

<Callout type="warning">
The basePath must exactly match your repository name. If they don't match, assets will return 404 errors.
</Callout>

### customDomain

**Type:** `boolean`
**Default:** `false`

Set to `true` when using a custom domain with GitHub Pages.

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "github-pages",
    "customDomain": true,
    "basePath": ""
  }
}
```

This tells Specra to serve assets from the root `/` instead of `/repo-name/`.

## Platform-Specific Configurations

### Vercel

Default configuration works perfectly:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "vercel"
  }
}
```

**Build command:** `npm run build`
**Output:** `.next` directory
**No basePath needed**

### GitHub Pages (No Custom Domain)

For `username.github.io/repo-name`:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "github-pages",
    "basePath": "repo-name",
    "customDomain": false
  }
}
```

**Build command:** `npm run build:export`
**Output:** `out` directory
**Assets load from:** `/repo-name/_next/...`

### GitHub Pages (With Custom Domain)

For `docs.example.com`:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "custom-domain-static",
    "basePath": "",
    "customDomain": true
  }
}
```

Also add `public/CNAME`:
```
docs.example.com
```

**Build command:** `npm run build:export`
**Output:** `out` directory
**Assets load from:** `/_next/...`

### Netlify

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "static"
  }
}
```

**Build command:** `npm run build:export`
**Output:** `out` directory
**No basePath needed**

### Cloudflare Pages

Same as Netlify:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "static"
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### Build Modes

Specra has two build modes:

**1. Standalone (Node.js hosting)**
- Used for: Vercel, Railway, Render
- Command: `npm run build`
- Output: `.next` directory
- Runs as Node.js server
- Supports dynamic features

**2. Static Export (Static hosting)**
- Used for: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages
- Command: `npm run build:export`
- Output: `out` directory
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS files
- No server required

The `deployment.target` determines which mode to use.

### Asset Path Resolution

Specra uses the `getAssetPath()` utility to handle asset URLs:

```typescript
// Automatically adjusts based on deployment config
getAssetPath('/images/logo.png')

// Vercel: /images/logo.png
// GitHub Pages (no custom domain): /repo-name/images/logo.png
// GitHub Pages (custom domain): /images/logo.png
```

You don't need to worry about this - Specra handles it automatically based on your config.

## Switching Platforms

### From Vercel to GitHub Pages

1. Update config:
```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "github-pages",
    "basePath": "your-repo-name"
  }
}
```

2. Change build command:
```bash
npm run build:export  # instead of npm run build
```

3. Deploy `out/` folder instead of `.next/`

### From GitHub Pages to Netlify

1. Update config:
```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "static",
    "basePath": ""
  }
}
```

2. Keep using `npm run build:export`

3. Netlify serves from root, so remove basePath

## Testing Locally

### Test Static Export

```bash
npm run build:export
npx serve out
```

Open the URL shown (usually `http://localhost:3000`). Verify:
- Pages load correctly
- Images appear
- Links work
- Navigation functions

### Test with basePath

If using basePath, test locally with a server that respects it:

```bash
npm run build:export
npx serve out -s -p 3000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000/your-repo-name` to simulate GitHub Pages.

## Troubleshooting

### Assets Return 404

**Check basePath matches repo name:**
```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "basePath": "exact-repo-name"  // Must match exactly
  }
}
```

**Verify you're using the right build command:**
- GitHub Pages: `npm run build:export` (not `npm run build`)
- Vercel: `npm run build` (not `npm run build:export`)

### Blank Page After Deploy

**Check target is correct:**
- GitHub Pages needs `"target": "github-pages"`
- Netlify needs `"target": "static"`
- Vercel needs `"target": "vercel"`

**Verify deployment settings match config:**
- Output directory should match build mode
- Build command should match target

### Custom Domain Not Working

**Ensure customDomain is true:**
```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "customDomain": true,
    "basePath": ""
  }
}
```

**Check CNAME file exists:**
- Must be in `public/CNAME`
- Contains only your domain
- No protocol, no trailing slash

## Best Practices

**Keep config in version control** - Commit `specra.config.json` so deployments are consistent

**Test locally before deploying** - Use `npx serve out` to test static exports

**Use environment-specific configs** - Different configs for staging and production if needed

**Document your setup** - Add deployment instructions to your README

**Verify after switching platforms** - Test everything works when changing deployment targets

# Deploy to Netlify

Netlify provides powerful static hosting with features like instant rollbacks, split testing, and edge functions. It's a great choice for documentation sites.

## Why Netlify?

- **One-click deploy** - Connect and deploy in minutes
- **Continuous deployment** - Auto-deploy on git push
- **Instant rollbacks** - Restore previous versions instantly
- **Edge functions** - Run code at the edge
- **Forms & identity** - Built-in form handling and auth
- **Free tier** - Generous limits for documentation

## Quick Deploy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure for Static Export">
    Update `specra.config.json`:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "static",
    "basePath": "",
    "customDomain": false
  }
}
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create netlify.toml">
    Add build configuration at project root:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build:export"
  publish = "out"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

This tells Netlify how to build and what to publish.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    **Option 1: Web UI**
    1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
    2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
    3. Connect your Git provider
    4. Select your repository
    5. Click "Deploy site"

**Option 2: Netlify CLI**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
Your site is now live at a Netlify URL like `random-name-123.netlify.app`
</Callout>

## Configuration

### Build Settings

Netlify auto-detects settings, but you can customize:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Build command | `npm run build:export` |
| Publish directory | `out` |
| Node version | 20 (set in `netlify.toml`) |

### Environment Variables

Add environment variables in the Netlify dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Site Settings">
    Click your site → Site settings → Environment variables
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Variables">
```
MEILISEARCH_HOST=https://search.example.com
MEILISEARCH_API_KEY=your-search-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

<Callout type="tip">
Variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser. Keep sensitive keys without this prefix.
</Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Redeploy">
    Go to Deploys → Trigger deploy → Deploy site
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom Domain

Add your own domain to your Netlify site:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Domain">
    1. Go to Domain settings
    2. Click "Add custom domain"
    3. Enter your domain (e.g., `docs.example.com`)
    4. Click "Verify"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure DNS">
    **Option 1: Use Netlify DNS (Recommended)**
    - Point your domain's nameservers to Netlify
    - Netlify manages all DNS records
    - Automatic SSL certificate

**Option 2: Use External DNS**

For subdomain:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: docs
Value: your-site.netlify.app
```

For apex domain:
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable HTTPS">
    Netlify automatically provisions an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.

Check Domain settings → HTTPS for status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deploy Previews

Netlify creates preview deployments for every pull request:

**What you get:**
- Unique URL for each PR
- Automatic updates when you push
- Deploy preview link in PR comments
- Perfect for reviewing changes

### Configure Deploy Previews

Control when previews are created:

```toml
[context.deploy-preview]
  command = "npm run build:export"

[context.branch-deploy]
  command = "npm run build:export"
```

## Advanced Features

### Redirect Rules

Add redirects in `netlify.toml`:

```toml
# Redirect old URLs
[[redirects]]
  from = "/old-page"
  to = "/new-page"
  status = 301

# SPA fallback
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

# Country-based redirects
[[redirects]]
  from = "/docs"
  to = "/en/docs"
  status = 302
  conditions = {Country = ["US"]}
```

### Headers

Add custom headers:

```toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'"

[[headers]]
  for = "/assets/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
```

### Edge Functions

Run code at the edge for dynamic functionality:

Create `netlify/edge-functions/hello.ts`:

```typescript
export default async (request: Request) => {
  return new Response("Hello from the edge!")
}

export const config = {
  path: "/api/hello"
}
```

### Split Testing

Test different versions of your docs:

1. Go to Split testing
2. Click "Start a test"
3. Select branches to compare
4. Set traffic split (e.g., 50/50)

Great for testing new documentation layouts or content.

## Build Plugins

Extend your build with Netlify plugins:

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-lighthouse"

[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-checklinks"
```

Install plugins:

```bash
npm install -D @netlify/plugin-lighthouse netlify-plugin-checklinks
```

## Deployment Contexts

Different configs for different branches:

```toml
# Production (main branch)
[context.production]
  command = "npm run build:export"
  [context.production.environment]
    NODE_ENV = "production"

# Staging branch
[context.staging]
  command = "npm run build:export"
  [context.staging.environment]
    NODE_ENV = "staging"

# Deploy previews (PRs)
[context.deploy-preview]
  command = "npm run build:export -- --debug"
```

## Performance Optimization

### Asset Optimization

Netlify automatically optimizes:
- Image compression
- Bundle minification
- Brotli compression

Enable in Build & deploy → Post processing.

### Caching

Configure cache headers:

```toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/_next/static/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[headers]]
  for = "/images/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=604800"
```

### Prerendering

For better SEO, enable prerendering:

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

## Forms

Add forms to your documentation:

```html
<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true">
  <input type="text" name="name" />
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

Netlify automatically handles form submissions. View responses in Forms tab.

## Analytics

Enable Netlify Analytics for visitor insights:

1. Go to Analytics tab
2. Click "Enable Analytics"
3. Costs $9/month (optional)

Shows:

  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build:export

      - name: Deploy to Netlify
        uses: nwtgck/actions-netlify@v2
        with:
          publish-dir: './out'
          production-deploy: true
        env:
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
```

Get your auth token and site ID from Netlify dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Check build logs:**
- Go to Deploys
- Click failed deploy
- View deploy log

**Common issues:**
- Node version mismatch (set in `netlify.toml`)
- Missing dependencies (use `npm ci` not `npm install`)
- Environment variables not set

### Assets 404

Ensure `netlify.toml` has the SPA redirect:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Functions Not Working

Check function logs:
1. Go to Functions tab
2. Click your function
3. View logs

Ensure function path matches config:

```typescript
export const config = {
  path: "/api/hello"  // Must match your route
}
```

### Custom Domain SSL Issues

- Wait 24 hours for DNS propagation
- Verify DNS records with `dig` or `nslookup`
- Check HTTPS status in Domain settings
- Try re-provisioning certificate

## Rollbacks

Instantly rollback to a previous deployment:

1. Go to Deploys
2. Find the working version
3. Click "Publish deploy"

Your site reverts immediately. No waiting for builds.

## Monitoring

### Deploy Notifications

Get notified when deploys succeed or fail:

1. Go to Site settings → Build & deploy → Deploy notifications
2. Add notification (Email, Slack, webhook)
3. Choose events (deploy started, succeeded, failed)

### Status Badge

Add a deploy status badge to your README:

```markdown
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/SITE_ID/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/SITE_NAME/deploys)
```

## Pricing

Netlify's free tier includes:
- 300 build minutes/month
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- Unlimited sites
- Deploy previews
- HTTPS
- Forms (100 submissions/month)

Upgrade to Pro ($19/month) for:
- More bandwidth and build minutes
- Analytics
- Team collaboration
- Priority support

## Best Practices

**Use `netlify.toml`** - Version control your build config

**Enable deploy previews** - Review changes before merging

**Set up notifications** - Know immediately when deploys fail

**Use environment variables** - Keep secrets out of code

**Configure redirects** - Handle URL changes properly

**Monitor analytics** - Understand how users navigate your docs

**Test locally** - Run `npm run build:export && npx serve out` first

# Deploy to Netlify

Netlify provides powerful static hosting with features like instant rollbacks, split testing, and edge functions. It's a great choice for documentation sites.

## Why Netlify?

- **One-click deploy** - Connect and deploy in minutes
- **Continuous deployment** - Auto-deploy on git push
- **Instant rollbacks** - Restore previous versions instantly
- **Edge functions** - Run code at the edge
- **Forms & identity** - Built-in form handling and auth
- **Free tier** - Generous limits for documentation

## Quick Deploy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure for Static Export">
    Update `specra.config.json`:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "target": "static",
    "basePath": "",
    "customDomain": false
  }
}
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create netlify.toml">
    Add build configuration at project root:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build:export"
  publish = "out"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

This tells Netlify how to build and what to publish.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    **Option 1: Web UI**
    1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
    2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
    3. Connect your Git provider
    4. Select your repository
    5. Click "Deploy site"

**Option 2: Netlify CLI**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
Your site is now live at a Netlify URL like `random-name-123.netlify.app`
</Callout>

## Configuration

### Build Settings

Netlify auto-detects settings, but you can customize:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Build command | `npm run build:export` |
| Publish directory | `out` |
| Node version | 20 (set in `netlify.toml`) |

### Environment Variables

Add environment variables in the Netlify dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Site Settings">
    Click your site → Site settings → Environment variables
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Variables">
```
MEILISEARCH_HOST=https://search.example.com
MEILISEARCH_API_KEY=your-search-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

<Callout type="tip">
Variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser. Keep sensitive keys without this prefix.
</Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Redeploy">
    Go to Deploys → Trigger deploy → Deploy site
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom Domain

Add your own domain to your Netlify site:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Domain">
    1. Go to Domain settings
    2. Click "Add custom domain"
    3. Enter your domain (e.g., `docs.example.com`)
    4. Click "Verify"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure DNS">
    **Option 1: Use Netlify DNS (Recommended)**
    - Point your domain's nameservers to Netlify
    - Netlify manages all DNS records
    - Automatic SSL certificate

**Option 2: Use External DNS**

For subdomain:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: docs
Value: your-site.netlify.app
```

For apex domain:
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable HTTPS">
    Netlify automatically provisions an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.

Check Domain settings → HTTPS for status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deploy Previews

Netlify creates preview deployments for every pull request:

**What you get:**
- Unique URL for each PR

# Setting Up Search

Specra supports powerful full-text search through MeiliSearch integration. This guide shows you how to set up and configure search for your documentation.

## Search Options

Specra offers two search solutions:

**Local Search** (Default)
- Works out of the box
- No external dependencies
- Good for small to medium doc sites
- Searches in the browser

**MeiliSearch** (Recommended for production)
- Blazing fast search engine
- Typo tolerance
- Instant results
- Better for large doc sites
- Requires separate server

## Quick Start with MeiliSearch

### Prerequisites

- Docker (easiest setup) or ability to run a MeiliSearch server
- Your documentation site already set up with Specra

### Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run MeiliSearch with Docker">
    The easiest way to get MeiliSearch running locally:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name meilisearch \
  -p 7700:7700 \
  -e MEILI_MASTER_KEY="aSampleMasterKey" \
  -v $(pwd)/meili_data:/meili_data \
  getmeili/meilisearch:latest
```

This starts MeiliSearch on `http://localhost:7700` with a master key for authentication.

<Callout type="warning">
  Use a strong master key in production! This example key is for development only.
</Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Specra">
    Update your `specra.config.json`:

```json
{
  "search": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "meilisearch",
    "placeholder": "Search documentation...",
    "meilisearch": {
      "host": "http://localhost:7700",
      "apiKey": "aSampleMasterKey",
      "indexName": "docs"
    }
  }
}
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Index Your Content">
    Specra includes indexing utilities. Run this from your project root:

```bash
npm run index:search
```

This scans your `docs/` folder and sends all content to MeiliSearch for indexing.

<Callout type="info">
  Re-run the indexing command whenever you add or update documentation.
</Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Search">
    Start your dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Press **⌘K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux) to open the search modal. Start typing to see instant results!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## MeiliSearch Configuration

### Configuration Options

All MeiliSearch settings go in `specra.config.json` under the `search` section:

```json
{
  "search": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "meilisearch",
    "placeholder": "Search docs...",
    "meilisearch": {
      "host": "http://localhost:7700",
      "apiKey": "your-api-key",
      "indexName": "docs"
    }
  }
}
```

**Field reference:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | Enable/disable search feature |
| `provider` | string | "meilisearch" or "local" |
| `placeholder` | string | Placeholder text in search box |
| `meilisearch.host` | string | MeiliSearch server URL |
| `meilisearch.apiKey` | string | API key for authentication |
| `meilisearch.indexName` | string | Index name for your docs |

### Search Key vs Master Key

MeiliSearch uses two types of keys:

**Master Key** (development)
- Full access to all operations
- Used for indexing content
- Never expose in client-side code in production

**Search Key** (production)
- Read-only access
- Safe to use in browser
- Generate from master key

Generate a search key:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/keys' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer aSampleMasterKey' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "description": "Search key for documentation",
    "actions": ["search"],
    "indexes": ["docs"],
    "expiresAt": null
  }'
```

Use the returned key in your production config.

## Production Deployment

### Hosting MeiliSearch

For production, you need to host MeiliSearch separately from your docs. Options:

**MeiliSearch Cloud** (Easiest)
- Official managed hosting
- Starts at $0.02/hour
- Automatic backups and updates
- Visit [meilisearch.com/cloud](https://www.meilisearch.com/cloud)

**Self-hosted on VPS**
- DigitalOcean, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.
- More control, requires maintenance
- Use Docker or binary installation

**Railway / Render / Fly.io**
- One-click deploy options available
- Good for small to medium projects

### Production Configuration

Update `specra.config.json` for production:

```json
{
  "search": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "meilisearch",
    "meilisearch": {
      "host": "https://your-meilisearch-domain.com",
      "apiKey": "your-public-search-key",
      "indexName": "docs"
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Always use a search-only API key in production, never your master key!
</Callout>

### Indexing in CI/CD

Automate indexing when you deploy. Example GitHub Action:

```yaml
name: Index Documentation

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'docs/**'

jobs:
  index:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Index documentation
        env:
          MEILISEARCH_HOST: ${{ secrets.MEILISEARCH_HOST }}
          MEILISEARCH_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MEILISEARCH_MASTER_KEY }}
        run: npm run index:search
```

Store your MeiliSearch credentials as GitHub secrets.

## Customizing Search Behavior

### Search Settings

Configure how MeiliSearch handles searches:

```javascript
// In your indexing script
const settings = {
  searchableAttributes: [
    'title',
    'description',
    'content',
    'headings'
  ],
  displayedAttributes: [
    'title',
    'description',
    'url',
    'breadcrumb'
  ],
  rankingRules: [
    'words',
    'typo',
    'proximity',
    'attribute',
    'sort',
    'exactness'
  ],
  stopWords: ['the', 'a', 'an'],
  synonyms: {
    'js': ['javascript'],
    'ts': ['typescript']
  }
}
```

### Filters

Add filters to narrow search results:

```json
{
  "search": {
    "meilisearch": {
      "filters": "version = 'v1.0.0'"
    }
  }
}
```

This only shows results from a specific version.

## Local Search (Alternative)

If you don't want to run MeiliSearch, use local search:

```json
{
  "search": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "local",
    "placeholder": "Search documentation..."
  }
}
```

Local search:
- ✅ Works immediately, no setup
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Free
- ❌ Less powerful than MeiliSearch
- ❌ No typo tolerance
- ❌ Slower for large doc sites

Local search is automatically built during `npm run build`.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Users can trigger search with:

- **⌘K** or **Ctrl+K** - Open search
- **Escape** - Close search
- **↑↓** - Navigate results
- **Enter** - Go to selected result

These work with both local and MeiliSearch options.

## Troubleshooting

### Search not appearing

**Check configuration:**
```json
{
  "search": {
    "enabled": true  // ← Must be true
  }
}
```

**Verify MeiliSearch is running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:7700/health
```

Should return `{"status":"available"}`.

### No search results

**Re-index your content:**
```bash
npm run index:search
```

**Check index exists:**
```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:7700/indexes' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer aSampleMasterKey'
```

### CORS errors

If you get CORS errors in browser console, configure MeiliSearch to allow your domain:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name meilisearch \
  -p 7700:7700 \
  -e MEILI_MASTER_KEY="aSampleMasterKey" \
  -e MEILI_HTTP_ADDR="0.0.0.0:7700" \
  -e MEILI_NO_ANALYTICS=true \
  getmeili/meilisearch:latest
```

Or set CORS headers in your reverse proxy.

### Slow indexing

For large doc sites (1000+ pages):

- Index incrementally (only changed files)
- Use batch requests
- Increase MeiliSearch memory allocation
- Run indexing in background jobs

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Language Search

Configure language-specific stemming:

```javascript
const settings = {
  searchableAttributes: ['title', 'content'],
  attributesForFaceting: ['lang'],
  // ... other settings
}

// Index with language tags
{
  title: "Getting Started",
  content: "...",
  lang: "en",
  url: "/docs/en/getting-started"
}
```

### Search Analytics

Track what users search for:

```javascript
// In your search component
const logSearch = async (query, resultsCount) => {
  await fetch('/api/analytics/search', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, resultsCount })
  })
}
```

Use this data to improve documentation based on what users look for.

### Custom Result Rendering

Override the search result component to customize how results appear:

```tsx
// components/custom-search-result.tsx
export function CustomSearchResult({ hit }) {
  return (
    <div className="search-result">
      <h3>{hit.title}</h3>
      <p>{hit.description}</p>
      <span className="version">{hit.version}</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

    "SUPPORT_EMAIL": "support@example.com"
  }
}
```

Access in MDX:

```mdx
API endpoint: {process.env.API_BASE_URL}
Current version: {process.env.API_VERSION}
```

### From .env Files

Set values via environment files:

```bash
# .env.local
API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
MEILISEARCH_HOST=https://search.example.com
MEILISEARCH_API_KEY=your-key
```

Reference in config:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "API_BASE_URL": "${API_BASE_URL}"
  },
  "search": {
    "meilisearch": {
      "host": "${MEILISEARCH_HOST}",
      "apiKey": "${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}"
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
Never commit sensitive keys to version control. Use environment variables and add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`.
</Callout>

### Public vs Private Variables

**Private (server-only):**
```
MEILISEARCH_API_KEY=secret-key
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
```

**Public (exposed to browser):**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to make variables available in the browser.

## Theme Configuration

Customize visual appearance.

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "defaultMode": "system",
    "respectPrefersColorScheme": true,
    "primaryColor": "#3b82f6",
    "customCss": "/custom.css"
  }
}
```

**defaultMode**
- `"system"` - Match OS preference
- `"light"` - Always light mode
- `"dark"` - Always dark mode

**respectPrefersColorScheme**
- Honor OS color scheme preference
- Set to `false` to ignore OS settings

**primaryColor**
- Main brand color (hex code)
- Used for links, buttons, accents

**customCss**
- Path to custom CSS file
- Add in `public/` folder

See [Customization](/docs/v1.0.0/customization) for detailed theming guide.

# Theming & Customization

Make Specra your own. This guide covers everything from simple color changes to complete custom styling.

## Quick Customization

The fastest way to customize your docs is through `specra.config.json`.

### Brand Colors

Set your primary color to match your brand:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "primaryColor": "#3b82f6"
  }
}
```

Specra automatically generates all color variations (hover states, focus rings, etc.) from this single value.

### Dark Mode Settings

Control how dark mode works:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "defaultMode": "system",
    "respectPrefersColorScheme": true
  }
}
```

**Options for `defaultMode`:**
- `"system"` - Respect user's OS preference (recommended)
- `"light"` - Always start in light mode
- `"dark"` - Always start in dark mode

Set `respectPrefersColorScheme` to `false` to ignore OS settings and only use your default.

### Logos

Add your logo for light and dark modes:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "logo": {
      "light": "/logo-light.svg",
      "dark": "/logo-dark.svg"
    }
  }
}
```

Or use a single logo for both:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "logo": "/logo.svg"
  }
}
```

Place logo files in the `public/` directory.

## Custom CSS

For deeper customization, add custom CSS.

### Method 1: Custom CSS File

Create a CSS file and reference it in config:

**1. Create `/public/custom.css`:**

```css
:root {
  --font-heading: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
  --border-radius: 12px;
}

.doc-content h1 {
  font-size: 3rem;
  color: var(--color-primary);
}

.sidebar {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #f8f9fa, #ffffff);
}
```

**2. Reference in config:**

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "customCss": "/custom.css"
  }
}
```

### Method 2: Global Styles

Edit `app/globals.css` directly for more control:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  :root {
    /* Your custom properties */
    --radius: 0.75rem;
  }
}

@layer components {
  /* Your custom component styles */
  .custom-card {
    @apply rounded-lg border border-gray-200 p-4;
  }
}
```

## CSS Variables Reference

Specra uses CSS variables for theming. Override these to customize appearance:

### Colors

```css
:root {
  /* Primary brand color */
  --color-primary: #3b82f6;
  --color-primary-hover: #2563eb;
  --color-primary-light: #dbeafe;

  /* Background colors */
  --color-bg: #ffffff;
  --color-bg-secondary: #f9fafb;
  --color-bg-tertiary: #f3f4f6;

  /* Text colors */
  --color-text: #111827;
  --color-text-secondary: #6b7280;
  --color-text-tertiary: #9ca3af;

  /* Border colors */
  --color-border: #e5e7eb;
  --color-border-hover: #d1d5db;

  /* Code block colors */
  --color-code-bg: #f3f4f6;
  --color-code-text: #1f2937;
}

.dark {
  --color-bg: #111827;
  --color-bg-secondary: #1f2937;
  --color-bg-tertiary: #374151;

  --color-text: #f9fafb;
  --color-text-secondary: #d1d5db;
  --color-text-tertiary: #9ca3af;

  --color-border: #374151;
  --color-border-hover: #4b5563;

  --color-code-bg: #1f2937;
  --color-code-text: #f9fafb;
}
```

### Typography

```css
:root {
  /* Font families */
  --font-sans: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
  --font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace;
  --font-heading: var(--font-sans);

  /* Font sizes */
  --text-xs: 0.75rem;
  --text-sm: 0.875rem;
  --text-base: 1rem;
  --text-lg: 1.125rem;
  --text-xl: 1.25rem;
  --text-2xl: 1.5rem;
  --text-3xl: 1.875rem;
  --text-4xl: 2.25rem;

  /* Line heights */
  --leading-tight: 1.25;
  --leading-normal: 1.5;
  --leading-relaxed: 1.75;
}
```

### Spacing

```css
:root {
  /* Border radius */
  --radius-sm: 0.25rem;
  --radius: 0.5rem;
  --radius-md: 0.75rem;
  --radius-lg: 1rem;
  --radius-xl: 1.5rem;

  /* Shadows */
  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
  --shadow: 0 1px 3px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

## Custom Fonts

### Using Google Fonts

**1. Add font to your layout:**

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { Inter, JetBrains_Mono } from 'next/font/google'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })
const jetbrainsMono = JetBrains_Mono({ subsets: ['latin'] })

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={`${inter.className}`}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

**2. Update CSS variables:**

```css
:root {
  --font-sans: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;
}
```

### Using Local Fonts

Place font files in `public/fonts/` and load them:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'CustomFont';
  src: url('/fonts/custom-font.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}

:root {
  --font-sans: 'CustomFont', system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

## Layout Customization

### Sidebar Width

Adjust sidebar width in your custom CSS:

```css
.sidebar {
  width: 280px; /* Default is 260px */
}

@media (min-width: 1280px) {
  .sidebar {
    width: 320px;
  }
}
```

### Content Width

Change maximum content width:

```css
.doc-content {
  max-width: 850px; /* Default is 800px */
}
```

### Table of Contents Position

Control TOC position via config:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tocPosition": "right",
    "showTableOfContents": true
  }
}
```

Options: `"left"` or `"right"`

## Component Styling

### Callout Styles

Customize callout appearance:

```css
.callout {
  border-left-width: 4px;
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
  padding: 1rem 1.5rem;
}

.callout-info {
  background: #dbeafe;
  border-color: #3b82f6;
  color: #1e3a8a;
}

.callout-warning {
  background: #fef3c7;
  border-color: #f59e0b;
  color: #92400e;
}

.dark .callout-info {
  background: #1e3a8a;
  color: #dbeafe;
}
```

### Code Block Styling

Customize syntax highlighting:

```css
.code-block {
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
  font-size: 0.9rem;
  line-height: 1.7;
}

.code-block-title {
  background: #374151;
  color: #f9fafb;
  font-family: var(--font-mono);
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg) var(--radius-lg) 0 0;
}
```

### Card Styling

Style card components:

```css
.card {
  border: 1px solid var(--color-border);
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
  padding: 1.5rem;
  transition: all 0.2s;
}

.card:hover {
  border-color: var(--color-primary);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-md);
  transform: translateY(-2px);
}
```

## Tailwind Configuration

Extend Tailwind for custom utilities:

```typescript
// tailwind.config.ts
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'

const config: Config = {
  content: [
    './app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './docs/**/*.{md,mdx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        brand: {
          50: '#f0f9ff',
          100: '#e0f2fe',
          500: '#0ea5e9',
          600: '#0284c7',
          700: '#0369a1',
        },
      },
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
        mono: ['JetBrains Mono', 'monospace'],
      },
      borderRadius: {
        '4xl': '2rem',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}

export default config
```

Use custom utilities in your CSS or MDX:

```mdx
<div className="bg-brand-50 dark:bg-brand-900 rounded-4xl p-6">
  Custom styled content
</div>
```

## Navigation Customization

### Top Navigation Links

Add custom navigation links:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "links": [
      { "label": "Home", "href": "/" },
      { "label": "Docs", "href": "/docs" },
      { "label": "Blog", "href": "/blog" },
      { "label": "GitHub", "href": "https://github.com/..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Social Links

Display social icons in header:

```json
{
  "social": {
    "github": "https://github.com/yourusername",
    "twitter": "https://twitter.com/yourusername",
    "discord": "https://discord.gg/invite",
    "custom": [
      {
        "label": "YouTube",
        "url": "https://youtube.com/@channel",
        "icon": "youtube"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Footer Customization

Customize footer content and links:

```json
{
  "footer": {
    "copyright": "© 2024 Your Company. All rights reserved.",
    "links": [
      {
        "title": "Product",
        "items": [
          { "label": "Features", "href": "/features" },
          { "label": "Pricing", "href": "/pricing" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "title": "Resources",
        "items": [
          { "label": "Documentation", "href": "/docs" },
          { "label": "API Reference", "href": "/api" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "branding": {
      "showBranding": true,
      "logo": "/footer-logo.svg",
      "title": "Your Brand",
      "url": "https://yoursite.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced Customization

### Custom Components

Create custom MDX components:

```tsx
// components/custom/feature-grid.tsx
interface FeatureGridProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
}

export function FeatureGrid({ children }: FeatureGridProps) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Use in MDX:

```mdx
import { FeatureGrid } from '@/components/custom/feature-grid'

<FeatureGrid>
  <Card title="Feature 1" />
  <Card title="Feature 2" />
  <Card title="Feature 3" />
</FeatureGrid>
```

### Custom Layout

Override the default doc layout:

```tsx
// app/docs/[...slug]/layout.tsx
import { CustomDocLayout } from '@/components/layouts/custom-doc-layout'

export default function DocsLayout({ children }) {
  return <CustomDocLayout>{children}</CustomDocLayout>
}
```

### Custom Search UI

Replace the default search component:

```tsx
// components/search/custom-search.tsx
export function CustomSearch() {
  return (
    <div className="search-container">
      {/* Your custom search implementation */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Examples

### Minimal Clean Theme

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #000000;
  --radius: 0.25rem;
  --font-sans: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
}

.doc-content {
  max-width: 700px;
  font-size: 1.125rem;
  line-height: 1.8;
}

.sidebar {
  border-right: 1px solid #e5e7eb;
  background: #ffffff;
}
```

### Vibrant Modern Theme

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #8b5cf6;
  --color-primary-hover: #7c3aed;
  --radius-lg: 1.5rem;
  --font-heading: 'Outfit', system-ui, sans-serif;
}

.card {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
  color: white;
  border: none;
}

.callout {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #fef3c7, #fed7aa);
  border: 2px solid #f59e0b;
}
```

### Dark-First Theme

```css
:root {
  --color-bg: #0a0a0a;
  --color-bg-secondary: #141414;
  --color-text: #fafafa;
  --color-border: #262626;
  --color-primary: #10b981;
}

.sidebar {
  background: #0a0a0a;
  border-right: 1px solid #262626;
}

.doc-content {
  color: #d4d4d4;
}

code {
  background: #1a1a1a;
  color: #10b981;
}
```

## Best Practices

**Start small.** Begin with config-based customization before writing custom CSS.

**Use CSS variables.** They make theme switching and maintenance easier.

**Test dark mode.** Always test your customizations in both light and dark modes.

**Keep it accessible.** Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text).

**Optimize fonts.** Use font-display: swap and subset fonts to improve load times.

**Mobile first.** Test your customizations on mobile devices.

# Theming & Customization

Make Specra your own. This guide covers everything from simple color changes to complete custom styling.

## Quick Customization

The fastest way to customize your docs is through `specra.config.json`.

### Brand Colors

Set your primary color to match your brand:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "primaryColor": "#3b82f6"
  }
}
```

Specra automatically generates all color variations (hover states, focus rings, etc.) from this single value.

### Dark Mode Settings

Control how dark mode works:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "defaultMode": "system",
    "respectPrefersColorScheme": true
  }
}
```

**Options for `defaultMode`:**
- `"system"` - Respect user's OS preference (recommended)
- `"light"` - Always start in light mode
- `"dark"` - Always start in dark mode

Set `respectPrefersColorScheme` to `false` to ignore OS settings and only use your default.

### Logos

Add your logo for light and dark modes:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "logo": {
      "light": "/logo-light.svg",
      "dark": "/logo-dark.svg"
    }
  }
}
```

Or use a single logo for both:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "logo": "/logo.svg"
  }
}
```

Place logo files in the `public/` directory.

## Custom CSS

For deeper customization, add custom CSS.

### Method 1: Custom CSS File

Create a CSS file and reference it in config:

**1. Create `/public/custom.css`:**

```css
:root {
  --font-heading: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
  --border-radius: 12px;
}

.doc-content h1 {
  font-size: 3rem;
  color: var(--color-primary);
}

.sidebar {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #f8f9fa, #ffffff);
}
```

**2. Reference in config:**

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "customCss": "/custom.css"
  }
}
```

### Method 2: Global Styles

Edit `app/globals.css` directly for more control:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  :root {
    /* Your custom properties */
    --radius: 0.75rem;
  }
}

@layer components {
  /* Your custom component styles */
  .custom-card {
    @apply rounded-lg border border-gray-200 p-4;
  }
}
```

## CSS Variables Reference

Specra uses CSS variables for theming. Override these to customize appearance:

### Colors

```css
:root {
  /* Primary brand color */
  --color-primary: #3b82f6;
  --color-primary-hover: #2563eb;
  --color-primary-light: #dbeafe;

  /* Background colors */
  --color-bg: #ffffff;
  --color-bg-secondary: #f9fafb;
  --color-bg-tertiary: #f3f4f6;

  /* Text colors */
  --color-text: #111827;
  --color-text-secondary: #6b7280;
  --color-text-tertiary: #9ca3af;

  /* Border colors */
  --color-border: #e5e7eb;
  --color-border-hover: #d1d5db;

  /* Code block colors */
  --color-code-bg: #f3f4f6;
  --color-code-text: #1f2937;
}

.dark {
  --color-bg: #111827;
  --color-bg-secondary: #1f2937;
  --color-bg-tertiary: #374151;

  --color-text: #f9fafb;
  --color-text-secondary: #d1d5db;
  --color-text-tertiary: #9ca3af;

  --color-border: #374151;
  --color-border-hover: #4b5563;

  --color-code-bg: #1f2937;
  --color-code-text: #f9fafb;
}
```

### Typography

```css
:root {
  /* Font families */
  --font-sans: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
  --font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace;
  --font-heading: var(--font-sans);

  /* Font sizes */
  --text-xs: 0.75rem;

```

## Custom Fonts

### Using Google Fonts

**1. Add font to your layout:**

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { Inter, JetBrains_Mono } from 'next/font/google'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })
const jetbrainsMono = JetBrains_Mono({ subsets: ['latin'] })

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={`${inter.className}`}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

**2. Update CSS variables:**

```css
:root {
  --font-sans: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;
}
```

### Using Local Fonts

Place font files in `public/fonts/` and load them:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'CustomFont';
  src: url('/fonts/custom-font.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}

:root {
  --font-sans: 'CustomFont', system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

## Layout Customization

### Sidebar Width

Adjust sidebar width in your custom CSS:

```css
.sidebar {
  width: 280px; /* Default is 260px */
}

@media (min-width: 1280px) {
  .sidebar {
    width: 320px;
  }
}
```

### Content Width

Change maximum content width:

```css
.doc-content {
  max-width: 850px; /* Default is 800px */
}
```

### Table of Contents Position

Control TOC position via config:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tocPosition": "right",
    "showTableOfContents": true
  }
}
```

Options: `"left"` or `"right"`

## Component Styling

### Callout Styles

Customize callout appearance:

```css
.callout {
  border-left-width: 4px;
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
  padding: 1rem 1.5rem;
}

.callout-info {
  background: #dbeafe;
  border-color: #3b82f6;
  color: #1e3a8a;
}

.callout-warning {
  background: #fef3c7;
  border-color: #f59e0b;
  color: #92400e;
}

.dark .callout-info {
  background: #1e3a8a;
  color: #dbeafe;
}
```

### Code Block Styling

Customize syntax highlighting:

```css
.code-block {
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
  font-size: 0.9rem;
  line-height: 1.7;
}

.code-block-title {
  background: #374151;
  color: #f9fafb;
  font-family: var(--font-mono);
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg) var(--radius-lg) 0 0;
}
```

### Card Styling

Style card components:

```css
.card {
  border: 1px solid var(--color-border);
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
  padding: 1.5rem;
  transition: all 0.2s;
}

.card:hover {
  border-color: var(--color-primary);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-md);
  transform: translateY(-2px);
}
```

## Tailwind Configuration

Extend Tailwind for custom utilities:

```typescript
// tailwind.config.ts
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'

const config: Config = {
  content: [
    './app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './docs/**/*.{md,mdx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        brand: {
          50: '#f0f9ff',
          100: '#e0f2fe',
          500: '#0ea5e9',
          600: '#0284c7',
          700: '#0369a1',
        },
      },
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
        mono: ['JetBrains Mono', 'monospace'],
      },
      borderRadius: {
        '4xl': '2rem',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}

export default config
```

Use custom utilities in your CSS or MDX:

```mdx
<div className="bg-brand-50 dark:bg-brand-900 rounded-4xl p-6">
  Custom styled content
</div>
```

## Navigation Customization

### Top Navigation Links

Add custom navigation links:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "links": [
      { "label": "Home", "href": "/" },
      { "label": "Docs", "href": "/docs" },
      { "label": "Blog", "href": "/blog" },
      { "label": "GitHub", "href": "https://github.com/..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Social Links

Display social icons in header:

```json
{
  "social": {
    "github": "https://github.com/yourusername",
    "twitter": "https://twitter.com/yourusername",
    "discord": "https://discord.gg/invite",
    "custom": [
      {
        "label": "YouTube",
        "url": "https://youtube.com/@channel",
        "icon": "youtube"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Footer Customization

Customize footer content and links:

```json
{
  "footer": {
    "copyright": "© 2024 Your Company. All rights reserved.",
    "links": [
      {
        "title": "Product",
        "items": [
          { "label": "Features", "href": "/features" },
          { "label": "Pricing", "href": "/pricing" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "title": "Resources",
        "items": [
          { "label": "Documentation", "href": "/docs" },
          { "label": "API Reference", "href": "/api" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "branding": {
      "showBranding": true,
      "logo": "/footer-logo.svg",
      "title": "Your Brand",
      "url": "https://yoursite.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced Customization

### Custom Components

Create custom MDX components:

```tsx
// components/custom/feature-grid.tsx
interface FeatureGridProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
}

export function FeatureGrid({ children }: FeatureGridProps) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Use in MDX:

```mdx
import { FeatureGrid } from '@/components/custom/feature-grid'

<FeatureGrid>
  <Card title="Feature 1" />
  <Card title="Feature 2" />
  <Card title="Feature 3" />
</FeatureGrid>
```

### Custom Layout

Override the default doc layout:

```tsx
// app/docs/[...slug]/layout.tsx
import { CustomDocLayout } from '@/components/layouts/custom-doc-layout'

export default function DocsLayout({ children }) {
  return <CustomDocLayout>{children}</CustomDocLayout>
}
```

### Custom Search UI

Replace the default search component:

```tsx
// components/search/custom-search.tsx
export function CustomSearch() {
  return (
    <div className="search-container">
      {/* Your custom search implementation */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Examples

### Minimal Clean Theme

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #000000;
  --radius: 0.25rem;
  --font-sans: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
}

.doc-content {
  max-width: 700px;
  font-size: 1.125rem;
  line-height: 1.8;
}

.sidebar {
  border-right: 1px solid #e5e7eb;
  background: #ffffff;
}
```

### Vibrant Modern Theme

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #8b5cf6;
  --color-primary-hover: #7c3aed;
  --radius-lg: 1.5rem;
  --font-heading: 'Outfit', system-ui, sans-serif;
}

.card {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
  color: white;
  border: none;
}

.callout {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #fef3c7, #fed7aa);
  border: 2px solid #f59e0b;
}
```

### Dark-First Theme

```css
:root {
  --color-bg: #0a0a0a;
  --color-bg-secondary: #141414;
  --color-text: #fafafa;
  --color-border: #262626;
  --color-primary: #10b981;
}

.sidebar {
  background: #0a0a0a;
  border-right: 1px solid #262626;
}

.doc-content {
  color: #d4d4d4;
}

code {
  background: #1a1a1a;
  color: #10b981;
}
```

## Best Practices

**Start small.** Begin with config-based customization before writing custom CSS.

**Use CSS variables.** They make theme switching and maintenance easier.

**Test dark mode.** Always test your customizations in both light and dark modes.

**Keep it accessible.** Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text).

**Optimize fonts.** Use font-display: swap and subset fonts to improve load times.

**Mobile first.** Test your customizations on mobile devices.

The Columns component creates responsive grid layouts for organizing content side-by-side.

## Usage

```mdx
<Columns cols={{ sm: 1, md: 2, lg: 3 }}>
  <Column>First column content</Column>
  <Column>Second column content</Column>
  <Column>Third column content</Column>
</Columns>
```

## Live Examples

### Two Columns

<Columns cols={{ sm: 1, md: 2 }}>
  <Column>
    ### Left Column
    This content appears on the left side (or stacks on mobile).
  </Column>
  <Column>
    ### Right Column
    This content appears on the right side.
  </Column>
</Columns>

### Three Columns

<Columns cols={{ sm: 1, md: 2, lg: 3 }}>
  <Column>
    <Card title="Feature 1" description="First feature description" />
  </Column>
  <Column>
    <Card title="Feature 2" description="Second feature description" />
  </Column>
  <Column>
    <Card title="Feature 3" description="Third feature description" />
  </Column>
</Columns>

### Column Spanning

Use the `span` prop to make columns take up more space:

<Columns cols={{ sm: 1, md: 3 }}>
  <Column span={2}>
    ### Wide Column
    This column spans 2 of 3 columns for more prominent content.
  </Column>
  <Column>

## Caching System

### In-Memory Caching

The system uses an intelligent caching layer for expensive file system operations:

- **Version list caching**: Cached for 5 seconds in dev, 60 seconds in production
- **Document list caching**: Per-version caching with automatic invalidation
- **Individual document caching**: Keyed by version and slug

The cache automatically invalidates when MDX or configuration files change in development mode.

### Cache Statistics

In development mode, cache operations are logged to the console:

```
✅ [Cache] hit: getAllDocs:v1.0.0
❌ [Cache] miss: getDocBySlug:v1.0.0:configuration
⏱️  getDocBySlug(configuration): 45.23ms
```

## Hot Reload

### Real-Time Updates

The system monitors your `docs/` directory for changes and automatically refreshes the page when you save:

- Watches `.mdx` files for content changes
- Watches `_category_.json` files for navigation updates
- Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for efficient communication
- Only active in development mode

### How It Works

1. File watcher monitors the `docs/` directory recursively
2. When a file changes, the API sends an event to the browser
3. The browser triggers a soft refresh to reload the content
4. Cache is invalidated for affected files

## Static Generation

### Optimized Build Process

The build process uses cached data to speed up `generateStaticParams`:

```typescript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const versions = getCachedVersions()  // Cached
  const params = []

  for (const version of versions) {
    const docs = await getCachedAllDocs(version)  // Cached
    for (const doc of docs) {
      params.push({
        version,
        slug: doc.slug.split("/").filter(Boolean),
      })
    }
  }

  return params
}
```

### Performance Tips

For large documentation sites (1000+ files):

1. **Use folder organization**: Organize docs into logical folders to improve cache locality
2. **Enable draft mode**: Mark work-in-progress docs with `draft: true` to exclude from production builds
3. **Optimize images**: Use Next.js Image optimization for screenshots and diagrams
4. **Monitor build times**: Watch the performance logs during development

## Development Mode Features

### Performance Logging

When running `npm run dev`, you'll see detailed performance metrics:

```
⏱️  getAllDocs(v1.0.0): 234.56ms
⏱️  getDocBySlug(getting-started): 12.34ms
💾 Memory Usage: { rss: '156MB', heapTotal: '89MB', heapUsed: '67MB' }
```

### Debug Utilities

The system includes helpful debugging tools (dev mode only):

- **PerfTimer**: Measure operation duration
- **logCacheOperation**: Track cache hits/misses
- **logMemoryUsage**: Monitor memory consumption
- **debugLog**: Pretty-print complex objects

## Production Optimizations

### Static Site Generation

All documentation pages are pre-rendered at build time:

- Zero server-side rendering overhead
- Instant page loads
- Excellent SEO performance
- CDN-friendly static assets

### Bundle Optimization

- Server Components by default (minimal JavaScript)
- Client Components only where needed (tabs, theme switcher)
- Automatic code splitting per route
- Tree-shaking of unused dependencies

## Monitoring Performance

### Build Analysis

Monitor your build output for performance insights:

```bash
npm run build
```

Look for:
- Static page generation time
- Number of pages generated
- Bundle size warnings

### Development Metrics

During development, watch the console for:
- Cache hit/miss ratios (should improve over time)
- File operation timings (identify slow operations)
- Memory usage patterns (detect memory leaks)

## Best Practices

1. **Keep files organized**: Logical folder structure improves caching
2. **Use frontmatter wisely**: Add only necessary metadata
3. **Optimize content**: Large files (>1MB) should be split
4. **Monitor cache**: High miss rates indicate caching issues
5. **Clean builds**: Occasionally clear `.next/` for fresh builds

## Troubleshooting

### Slow Build Times

If builds are slow:

1. Check for extremely large MDX files (>5MB)
2. Reduce the number of concurrent pages being generated
3. Clear cache: Delete `.next/` and `node_modules/.cache/`
4. Update dependencies to latest versions

### Hot Reload Not Working

If changes aren't reflected:

1. Check that you're in development mode (`npm run dev`)
2. Look for errors in the browser console
3. Verify the `/api/mdx-watch` endpoint is responding
4. Hard refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Memory Issues

If experiencing high memory usage:

1. Check for circular references in documentation
2. Monitor cache size with `getCacheStats()`
3. Reduce `CACHE_TTL` in `lib/mdx-cache.ts`
4. Clear caches manually with `clearAllCaches()`

## Features

### Zoom Functionality

<Callout type="info">
Click on any image to view it in a full-screen lightbox. A zoom icon appears on hover.
</Callout>

### Captions

Add context to images with the `caption` prop. Captions are styled italicized and centered below the image.

### Optimization

Images are automatically optimized using Next.js Image component for:
- Lazy loading
- Responsive sizing
- Modern formats (WebP)
- Caching

## Best Practices

- Always provide descriptive `alt` text for accessibility
- Use appropriate `width` and `height` to prevent layout shift
- Add `caption` for complex diagrams or screenshots that need explanation
- Set `zoom={false}` for decorative or small images

Tab groups allow you to organize your documentation into different sections accessible through tabs at the top of your documentation pages. This is particularly useful for separating different types of content like SDK docs, API references, and guides.

## Overview

Tab groups provide a sticky navigation bar that:
- Sits below the header
- Filters sidebar content based on the active tab
- Persists across page navigation
- Supports icons from Lucide React
- Maintains auto-generated sidebar structure

## Configuration

Define tab groups in your `specra.config.json`:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabGroups": [
      {
        "id": "sdk",
        "label": "SDK Documentation",
        "icon": "code"
      },
      {
        "id": "api",
        "label": "API Reference",
        "icon": "zap"
      },
      {
        "id": "guides",
        "label": "Guides",
        "icon": "book-open"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Tab Group Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | Unique identifier for the tab group |
| `label` | string | Yes | Display text for the tab |
| `icon` | string | No | Lucide icon name (e.g., "code", "zap", "book-open") |

## Assigning Content to Tabs

There are two ways to assign content to tab groups:

### 1. File-Level Assignment

Add `tab_group` to the frontmatter of your MDX files:

```mdx
---
title: Getting Started
description: Quick start guide
tab_group: guides
---

# Getting Started

Your content here...
```

### 2. Folder-Level Assignment

Add `tab_group` to your `_category_.json` file to assign all files in that folder:

```json
{
  "label": "Components",
  "position": 2,
  "collapsible": true,
  "collapsed": false,
  "icon": "grid",
  "tab_group": "sdk"
}
```

All files within this folder will automatically inherit the `sdk` tab group.

## Behavior and Rules

### Default Tab Assignment

Files without a `tab_group` specified will automatically appear in the **first tab group** defined in your config.

### Precedence

File-level `tab_group` in frontmatter takes precedence over folder-level assignment from `_category_.json`.

### Tab Persistence

The active tab persists when:
- Navigating between pages within the same tab group
- Manually switching tabs
- Clicking links to pages in different tab groups (tab switches automatically)

### Initial Tab Selection

When you land on a page:
- The tab automatically switches to match the page's tab group
- On page reload, the tab reflects the current page's group
- Manual tab selection is preserved when navigating within the same group

## Best Practices

### 1. Logical Grouping

Group related content together:
- **SDK/Library docs**: Installation, configuration, API reference
- **API docs**: REST endpoints, GraphQL schemas, webhooks
- **Guides**: Tutorials, how-tos, best practices

### 2. Consistent Naming

Use clear, concise labels:
- ✅ "SDK Documentation", "API Reference", "Guides"
- ❌ "Docs1", "Section A", "Misc"

### 3. Meaningful Icons

Choose icons that represent the content:
- `code` for SDK/library documentation
- `zap` for API references
- `book-open` for guides and tutorials
- `rocket` for getting started content

### 4. Limit Tab Count

Keep the number of tabs manageable:
- **Recommended**: 2-4 tabs
- **Maximum**: 5-6 tabs
- Too many tabs can overwhelm users

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple SDK + API Split

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabGroups": [
      {
        "id": "sdk",
        "label": "SDK",
        "icon": "code"
      },
      {
        "id": "api",
        "label": "API",
        "icon": "zap"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Comprehensive Documentation

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabGroups": [
      {
        "id": "getting-started",
        "label": "Getting Started",
        "icon": "rocket"
      },
      {
        "id": "sdk",
        "label": "SDK Reference",
        "icon": "code"
      },
      {
        "id": "api",
        "label": "API Reference",
        "icon": "server"
      },
      {
        "id": "guides",
        "label": "Guides",
        "icon": "book-open"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Nested Folders

Tab groups work seamlessly with nested folder structures:

```txt
docs/v1.0.0/
├── components/              # tab_group: sdk
│   ├── _category_.json
│   ├── button.mdx
│   └── input.mdx
├── api/                     # tab_group: api
│   ├── _category_.json
│   ├── authentication.mdx
│   └── endpoints.mdx
└── guides/                  # tab_group: guides
    ├── _category_.json
    └── quickstart.mdx       # Can override with file-level tab_group
```

### Mixed Tab Groups in Same Folder

You can have files in the same folder belong to different tabs:

```txt
docs/v1.0.0/
├── _category_.json          # Default: tab_group: sdk
├── overview.mdx             # Inherits: sdk
├── api-overview.mdx         # Override: tab_group: api
└── tutorial.mdx             # Override: tab_group: guides
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tab Not Showing

**Problem**: Tab group defined but not visible

**Solutions**:
- Ensure at least one file is assigned to that tab group
- Check that the tab group `id` matches exactly in both config and frontmatter
- Verify `navigation.tabGroups` is defined in `specra.config.json`

### Content Appearing in Wrong Tab

**Problem**: Page shows up under incorrect tab

**Solutions**:
- Check file-level frontmatter for `tab_group` override
- Verify folder-level `_category_.json` has correct `tab_group`
- Remember: frontmatter takes precedence over `_category_.json`

### Tab Not Persisting

**Problem**: Tab resets when navigating

**Solutions**:
- This is expected behavior when navigating to a page in a different tab group
- The tab automatically switches to match the current page's group
- Manual selection persists only when navigating within the same tab group

## Comparison with Alternatives

### vs. Mintlify/Docusaurus

Unlike Mintlify and Docusaurus which require manual sidebar configuration, our tab groups:
- ✅ Auto-generate sidebar structure from folder hierarchy
- ✅ Support both file and folder-level assignments
- ✅ Persist tab state across navigation
- ✅ Automatically filter sidebar content
- ✅ Require minimal configuration

### Advantages

1. **Auto-generation**: No need to manually maintain sidebar structure
2. **Flexibility**: File-level overrides for granular control
3. **Persistence**: Smart tab state management
4. **Icons**: Built-in icon support from Lucide React
5. **Sticky Navigation**: Tabs stay visible while scrolling
